      "\n",
      "\"How can a midshipman and gentleman act in that way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice of Midshipman David Darrin, United States Navy, vibrated\n",
      "uneasily as he turned to his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a shame--that's what it is,\" quivered Mr. Farley, also of the\n",
      "third class at the United States Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the question is,\" propounded Midshipman Dan Dalzell, \"what are we\n",
      "going to do about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it any part of our business to bother with the fellow?\" demanded\n",
      "Farley half savagely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Farley was rather hot-tempered, though he was \"all there\" in points\n",
      "that involved the honor of the brigade of midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five midshipmen stood in the squalid, ill-odored back room of a Chinese\n",
      "laundry in the town of Annapolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sixth midshipman present in the handsome blue uniform of the\n",
      "brigade; and it was upon this sixth one that the anger and disgust of\n",
      "the other five had centered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay in a sleep too deep for stirring. On the still, foul air floated\n",
      "fumes that were new to those of his comrades who now gazed down on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To think that one of our class could make such a beast of himself!\"\n",
      "sighed Dave Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And on the morning of the very day we're to ship for the summer\n",
      "cruise,\" uttered Farley angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well\" growled Hallam, \"why not let this animal of lower grade sleep\n",
      "just where he is? Let him take what he has fairly brought upon himself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the very question that is agitating me,\" declared Dave Darrin,\n",
      "to whom these other members of the third class looked as a leader when\n",
      "there was a point involving class honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave had became a leader through suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Readers of the preceding volume in this series, \"DAVE DARRIN'S FIRST\n",
      "YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS,\" will need no introduction to this fine specimen of\n",
      "spirited and honorable young American.\n",
      "\n",
      "Readers of that preceding volume will recall how Dave Darrin and Dan\n",
      "Dalzell entered the United States Naval Academy, one appointed by a\n",
      "Congressman and the other by a United States Senator. Such readers will\n",
      "remember the difficult time that Dave and Dan had in getting through the\n",
      "work of the first hard, grinding year. They will also recall how Dave\n",
      "Darrin, when accused of treachery to his classmates, patiently bided his\n",
      "time until he, with the aid of some close friends, was able to\n",
      "demonstrate his innocence. Our readers will also remember how two\n",
      "evil-minded members of the then fourth class plotted to increase Damn's\n",
      "disgrace and to drive him out of the brigade; also how these two\n",
      "plotters, Midshipmen Henkel and Brimmer, were caught in their plotting\n",
      "and were themselves forced out of the brigade. Our readers know that\n",
      "before the end of the first year at the Naval Academy, Dave had fully\n",
      "reinstated himself in the esteem of his manly classmates, and how he\n",
      "quickly became the most popular and respected member of his class.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now only the day after the events whose narration closed the\n",
      "preceding volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Darrin and Dalzell were first of all brought to notice in \"THE HIGH\n",
      "SCHOOL BOYS' SERIES.\" In their High School days, back in Gridley, these\n",
      "two had been famous members of Dick & Co., a sextette of youngsters who\n",
      "had made a name for themselves in school athletics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, two other members of the sextette, had\n",
      "been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point,\n",
      "where they were serving in the corps of cadets and learning how to\n",
      "become Army officers in the not far distant future. All of the\n",
      "adventures of Dick and Greg are set forth in \"THE WEST POINT SERIES.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two remaining members of famous old Dick & Co., Tom Reade and Harry\n",
      "Hazelton, became civil engineers, and went West for their first taste of\n",
      "engineering work. Tom and Harry had some wonderful and startling\n",
      "adventures, as fully set forth in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS' SERIES.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On this early June day when we again encounter Dave Darrin and Dan\n",
      "Dalzell in their handsome Naval uniforms, all members of the first,\n",
      "second and third classes were due to be aboard one of the three great\n",
      "battleships that lay off the Yard at Annapolis at four p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three great battleships were the \"Massachusetts,\" the \"Iowa\" and\n",
      "the \"Indiana.\" These three huge, turreted fighting craft had their full\n",
      "crews aboard. Not one of the battleship commanders would allow a\n",
      "\"jackie\" ashore, except on business, through fear that many of the\n",
      "\"wilder\" ones might find the attractions on shore too alluring, and fail\n",
      "to return in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the young midshipmen it was different. These young men were\n",
      "officially and actually gentlemen, and could be trusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet here, in the back room of this laundry, was one who was apparently\n",
      "not dependable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young midshipman's name was Pennington, and the fact was that he\n",
      "lay in deep stupor from the effects of smoking opium!\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been a storekeeper, with a shop across the street, who had called\n",
      "the attention of Dave and his four comrades to the probable fate of\n",
      "another of their class.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow Hop runs a laundry, but I have heard evil stories about a lot of\n",
      "young fools who flock to his back room and get a chance to 'hit' the\n",
      "opium pipe,\" the storekeeper had stated to Dave. \"One of your men, or at\n",
      "least, one in a midshipman's uniform, went in there at eleven o'clock\n",
      "this forenoon, and he hasn't been out since. It is now nearly two\n",
      "o'clock and, I've been looking for some midshipmen to inform.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such had been the storekeeper's careful statement. The merchants of\n",
      "Annapolis always have a kindly feeling toward these fine young\n",
      "midshipmen. The storekeeper's purpose was to enable them to help their\n",
      "comrade out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the five had entered the laundry. The proprietor, Chow Hop, had\n",
      "attempted to bar their way to the rear room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dave had seized the yellow man and had flung him aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader already knows what they discovered, and how it affected these\n",
      "young men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring that copper-colored chink in here, if you'll be so good,\"\n",
      "directed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan and Hallam departed on the quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're wanted in there,\" proclaimed Dalzell, jerking a thumb over his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby,\" replied Chow Hop, looking up briefly from his ironing\n",
      "board.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get in there--do you hear?\" commanded Hallam, gripping the other's arm\n",
      "with all his force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lemme go chop-chop (quickly), or you get alle samee hurt--you\n",
      "sabby?\" scowled Chow Hop, using his free hand to raise a heavy flat-iron\n",
      "menacingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dan Dalzell jumped in, giving the Chinaman's wrist a wrench that\n",
      "caused him to drop the iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, without a bit of ceremony, Dan grasped the Oriental by the\n",
      "shoulders, wheeled him about, while he protested in guttural tones, and\n",
      "bluntly kicked the yellow-faced one through the door into the inner\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this summary proceeding both the Chinese helpers gripped their\n",
      "flat-irons firmly; and leaped forward to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an ugly temper the Chinaman is a bad man to oppose. But now this pair\n",
      "were faced by a pair of quietly smiling midshipmen who were also\n",
      "dangerous when angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You two, get back,\" ordered Dalzell, advancing fearlessly upon the\n",
      "pair. \"If you don't, we'll drag you out into the street and turn you\n",
      "over to the policemen. You 'sabby' that? You heathen are pretty likely\n",
      "to get into prison for this day's work!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scowling for a moment, then muttering savagely, the two helpers slunk\n",
      "back to their ironing boards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, while Dan turned to go into the rear room, Hallam stood just where\n",
      "he was, to keep an eye on two possible sources of swift trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow Hop,\" began Dave Damn sternly, as the proprietor made his flying\n",
      "appearance, \"You've done a pretty mean piece of work here\"--pointing to\n",
      "the unconscious midshipman in the berth. \"Do you understand that you're\n",
      "pretty likely to go to prison for this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that no maller,\" replied Chow, with a sullen grin. \"Him plenty\n",
      "'shipmen come here and smoke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lie!\" hissed Dave, grasping the heathen by the collar and shaking\n",
      "him until the latter's teeth rattled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dave gave him a brief rest, though he still retained his hold on\n",
      "the Chinaman's collar. But the yellow man began struggling again, and\n",
      "Dave repeated the shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow Hop had kept his hands up inside his wide sleeves. Now Farley\n",
      "leaped forward as he shouted:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out, Darry! He has a knife!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farley attempted to seize the Chinaman's wrist, for the purpose of\n",
      "disarming the yellow man, but Dave swiftly threw the Chinaman around out\n",
      "of Farley's reach. Then, with a lightning-like move, Dave knocked the\n",
      "knife from Chow Hop's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pick that up and keep it for a curio, Farley,\" directed Dave coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another twinkling Darrin had run the Chinaman up against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smack! biff! thump!\n",
      "\n",
      "With increasing force Dave's hard fist struck the heathen in the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now stand there and behave yourself,\" admonished Midshipman Dave,\n",
      "dropping his hold on the yellow man's collar, \"or we'll stop playing\n",
      "with you and hurt you some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scowl on Chow Hop's face was ominous, but he stood still, glaring at\n",
      "Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow, what can we do to bring this man out of his sleep!\" asked Dave\n",
      "coolly, and almost in a friendly tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby,\" sulked the Chinaman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you do,\" retorted Dave warningly. \"Now, what can we do to get our\n",
      "friend out of this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You allee same cally (carry) him out,\" retorted Chow, with a suspicion\n",
      "of a sulky grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of that, now, you yellow-face!\" glared Dave. \"How shall we get our\n",
      "comrade out of this opium sleep!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby no way,\" insisted Chow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you do!\" snapped Dave. \"But you won't tell. All right; we'll\n",
      "find the way, and we'll punish you into the bargain. Dan, get a piece of\n",
      "paper from the other room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dalzell was quickly back with the desired item. On the paper Dave wrote\n",
      "a name and a telephone number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's near the end of the doctor's office hours,\" murmured Dave. \"Go to\n",
      "a telephone and ask the doctor to meet you at the corner above. Tell him\n",
      "it's vastly important, and ask him to meet you on the jump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell him what's up!\" asked Dan cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; you'd better. Then he'll be sure to bring the necessary remedies\n",
      "with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Dalzell was off like a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow tried to edge around toward the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, you get back there,\" cried Dave, seizing the Chinaman and\n",
      "slamming him back against the wall. \"Don't you move again, until we tell\n",
      "you that you may--or it will be the worse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes passed ere Dan returned with Dr. Lawrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see the job that's cut out for you,\" said Darrin, pointing to the\n",
      "unconscious figure in the bunk. \"Can you do it, Doctor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The medical man made a hasty examination of the unconscious midshipman\n",
      "before he answered briefly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will it be a long job, Doctor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifteen minutes, probably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, good, if you can do it in that time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me go now?\" asked Chow, with sullen curiosity, as the medical man\n",
      "opened his medicine-case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; if you don't try to leave the joint,\" agreed Dave. \"And I'm going\n",
      "outside with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow looked very much as though he did not care for company, but\n",
      "Midshipman Darrin kept at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, see here, Chow,\" warned Dave, \"this is the last day you sell\n",
      "opium for white men to smoke!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You heap too flesh (fresh)\" growled the Chinaman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the last day you'll sell opium to white men,\" insisted Dave, \"for,\n",
      "as soon as I'm through here I'm going to the police station to inform\n",
      "against you. They'll go through here like a twelve-inch shot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You alle same tell cop?\" grinned Chow, green hatred showing through his\n",
      "skin. \"Then I tell evelybody about you fliend in there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do just as you please about that,\" retorted Dave with pretended\n",
      "carelessness. \"For one thing, you don't know his name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I do,\" swaggered Chow impudently. \"Know heap 'bout him. His\n",
      "name alle same Pen'ton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seizing a marking brush and a piece of paper, Chow Hop quickly wrote out\n",
      "Pennington's name, correctly spelled. His ability to write English with\n",
      "a good hand was one of Chow's great vanities, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You go back to your ironing board, yellow-face,\" warned Darrin, and\n",
      "something in the young third classman's face showed Chow that it would\n",
      "be wise to obey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hallam drew Darrin to one side, to whisper earnestly in his ear:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out, old man, or you will get Pen into an awful scrape!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shan't do it,\" maintained Darrin. \"If it happens it will have been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'd better let the chink go, just to save one of our class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is a fellow who has turned opium fiend worth saving to the class!\"\n",
      "demanded Dave, looking straight into Hallam's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, er--er--\" stammered the other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see,\" smiled Dave, \"the doubt hits you just as hard as it does me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, of course, a fellow who has turned opium fiend is no fellow ever to\n",
      "be allowed to reach the bridge and the quarter-deck,\" admitted Hallam.\n",
      "\"But see here, are you going to report this affair to the commandant of\n",
      "midshipmen, or to anyone else in authority?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no occasion to report,\" replied Dave dryly. \"I am not in any way\n",
      "in command over Pennington. But I mean to persuade him to report himself\n",
      "for what he has done!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that would ruin him!\" protested Hallam, aghast. \"He wouldn't even\n",
      "be allowed to start on the cruise. He'd be railroaded home without loss\n",
      "of a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you've just said that an opium-user isn't fit to go on in the\n",
      "brigade,\" retorted Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang it, it's hard to know what to do,\" rejoined Hallam, wrinkling his\n",
      "forehead. \"Of course we want to be just to Pen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't strike me as being just exactly a question of justice to\n",
      "Pennington,\" Darrin went on earnestly. \"If this is anything it's a\n",
      "question of midshipman honor. We fellows are bound to see that all the\n",
      "unworthy ones are dropped from the service. Now, a fellow who has\n",
      "fastened the opium habit on himself isn't fit to go on, is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, say, but this is a hard one to settle!\" groaned Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll take all the responsibility upon myself,\" said Dave promptly.\n",
      "\"I don't want to make any mistake, and I don't believe I'm going to.\n",
      "Wait just a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to the rear room, Dave faced his three comrades there with the\n",
      "question:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You three are enough to take care of everything here for a few minutes,\n",
      "aren't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" nodded Dan. \"What's up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallam and I are going for a brief walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, stepping back into the front room, Darrin nodded to his classmate,\n",
      "who followed him outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just come along, and say nothing about the matter on the street,\"\n",
      "requested Dave. \"It might be overheard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" questioned Hallam wonderingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait and see, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From Chow Hop's wretched establishment it was not far to the other\n",
      "building that Dave had in mind as a destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they arrived, and stood at the foot of the steps, Hallam\n",
      "clutched Darrin's arm, holding him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, see here, this is the police station!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it,\" Dave replied calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But see here, you're not--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to drag you into anything that you'd object to,\" Darrin\n",
      "continued. \"Come along; all I want you for is as a witness to what I am\n",
      "going to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do it, old fel--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought that over, and I feel that I must,\" replied Dave firmly.\n",
      "\"Come along. Don't attract attention by standing here arguing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In another instant the two midshipmen were going swiftly up the steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief of police received his two callers courteously. Dave told the\n",
      "official how their attention had been called to the fact that one of\n",
      "their number was in an opium joint. Dave named the place, but requested\n",
      "the chief to wait a full hour before taking any action.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will give us a chance to get out a comrade who may have committed\n",
      "only his first offense,\" Dave continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's any opium being smoked in that place I'll surely close the\n",
      "joint out!\" replied the chief, bringing his fist down upon his desk.\n",
      "\"But I understand your reasons, Mr.--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darrin is my name, sir,\" replied Dave quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, Mr. Darrin, I give you my word that I won't even start my\n",
      "investigations before this evening. And I'll keep all quiet about the\n",
      "midshipman end of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Dave gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the two midshipmen strolled slowly back in the direction of Chow\n",
      "Hop's, Dave murmured:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, you see why I took this step?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid not very clearly,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That scoundrelly Chow made his boast that other midshipmen patronized\n",
      "his place. I don't believe it. Such a vice wouldn't appeal to you, and\n",
      "it doesn't to me. But there are more than two hundred new plebes coming\n",
      "in just now, and many of these boys have never been away from home\n",
      "before. Some of them might foolishly seek the lure of a new vice, and\n",
      "might find the habit fastened on them before they were aware of it.\n",
      "Chow's vile den might spoil some good material for the quarter-deck,\n",
      "and, as a matter of midshipman honor, we're bound to see that the place\n",
      "is cleaned out right away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess, Darry, you come pretty near being right,\" assented Hallam,\n",
      "after thinking for a few moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time they reached Chow Hop's again they found that Dr. Lawrence\n",
      "had brought the unfortunate Pennington to. And a very scared and\n",
      "humiliated midshipman it was who now stood up, a bit unsteadily, and\n",
      "tried to smooth down his uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you feel now?\" asked Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful!\" shuddered Pennington. \"And now see here, what are you fellows\n",
      "going to do? Blab, and see me driven out of the Navy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do any talking in here,\" advised Dave, with a meaning look over\n",
      "his shoulder at the yellow men in the outer room. \"Doctor, is our friend\n",
      "in shape to walk along with us now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will be, in two or three minutes, after he drinks something I'm\n",
      "going to give him,\" replied the medical man, shaking a few drops from\n",
      "each of three vials into a glass of water. \"Here, young man, drink this\n",
      "slowly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three minutes later the midshipmen left the place, Dave walking beside\n",
      "Pennington and holding his arm lightly for the purpose of steadying him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did this happen, Pen?\" queried Dave, when the six men of the third\n",
      "class at last found themselves walking down Maryland Avenue. \"How long\n",
      "have you been at this 'hop' trick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never before to-day,\" replied Midshipman Pennington quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pen, will you tell me that on your honor?\" asked Dave gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other midshipman flared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why must I give you my word of honor?\" he demanded defiantly. \"Isn't my\n",
      "plain word good enough?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your word of honor that you had never smoked opium before to-day would\n",
      "help to ease my mind a whole lot,\" replied Darrin. \"Come, unburden\n",
      "yourself, won't you, Pen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you, Darry, just how it happened. To-day _was_ the first\n",
      "time, on my word of honor, I came out into Annapolis with a raging\n",
      "toothache. Now, you know how a fellow gets to hate to go before the\n",
      "medical officers of the Academy with a tale about his teeth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" nodded Darrin. \"If a fellow is too much on the medical\n",
      "report for trouble with his teeth, then it makes the surgeons look his\n",
      "mouth over with all the more caution, and in the end a fellow may get\n",
      "dropped from the brigade just because he has invited over zeal from the\n",
      "dentist. But what has all this to do with opium smoking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just this,\" replied Pennington, hanging his head. \"I went into a drug\n",
      "store and asked a clerk that I know what was the best thing for\n",
      "toothache. He told me the best he knew was to smoke a pipe of opium, and\n",
      "told me where to find Chow Hop, and what to say to the chink. And it's\n",
      "all a lie about opium helping a sore tooth,\" cried the wretched\n",
      "midshipman, clapping a hand to his jaw, \"for there goes that fiendish\n",
      "tooth again! But say! You fellows are not going to leak about my little\n",
      "mishap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Darrin with great promptness. \"You're going to do that\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" gasped Midshipman Pennington in intense astonishment. \"What are\n",
      "you talking about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll be wise to turn in a report, on what happened,\" pursued Dave,\n",
      "\"for it's likely to reach official ears, anyway, and you'll be better\n",
      "off if you make the first report on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is it likely to reach official ears, if you fellows keep your\n",
      "mouths shut?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see,\" Darrin went on very quietly, \"I reported the joint at the\n",
      "police station, and Chow Hop threatened that, if I did, he'd tell all\n",
      "he knew about everybody. So you'd better be first----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You broke the game out to the police!\" gasped Pennington, staring\n",
      "dumfoundedly at his comrade. \"What on earth----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did it because I had more than one satisfactory reason for\n",
      "considering it my duty,\" interposed Dave, speaking quietly though\n",
      "firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--you--bag of wind!\" exploded Midshipman Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll accept your apology when you've had time to think it all over,\"\n",
      "replied Dave, with a smile, though there was a brief flash in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make no apology to you--at any time, you--you--greaser!\"\n",

      "Fully a hundred midshipmen, belonging to the first, second and third\n",

      "\n",
      "Several launches were darting back and forth over the water. The baggage\n",

      "stern as he passed through the opening in the rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here stood an officer with an open book in his hand. To him each\n",

      "berthing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry away to find your berthings, and get acquainted with the\n",
      "location,\" ordered this officer. \"Every midshipman will report on the\n",
      "quarter-deck promptly at five p.m. In the meantime, after locating your\n",

      "\n",
      "The latest arrivals saluted. Then, under the guidance of messengers\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to get mine changed, if I can,\" growled Pennington, wheeling\n",

      "\"See here, Hallam,\" began the worried midshipman, \"I begin to feel that\n",
      "it will be safer to turn in some kind of report on myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much safer,\" agreed Hallam. \"It will show good faith on your part if\n",
      "you report yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And get me broken from the service, too, I suppose,\" growled the\n",
      "unhappy one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly think it will, if you report yourself first,\" urged Hallam.\n",
      "\"But you'll be about certain to get your walking papers if you wait for\n",
      "the first information to come from other sources.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang it,\" groaned Pennington, \"I wish I could think, but my head aches\n",
      "as though it would split and my tooth is putting up more trouble than I\n",
      "ever knew there was in the world. And, in this racked condition, I'm to\n",
      "go and put myself on the pap-sheet. In what way shall I do it, Hallam?\n",
      "Can't you suggest something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" retorted Hallam with great energy. \"Go to the medical officer and\n",

      "So the pair went off in search of the sick-bay, as the hospital part of\n",

      "Dr. Mackenzie came at once, turned on a reflector light, and gazed into\n",
      "Midshipman Pennington's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you tried to treat this tooth yourself, in any way?\" queried the\n",

      "Pennington, with a quiver in his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was that?\" asked Dr. Mackenzie, glancing at him sharply. \"Did you\n",
      "try the aid of liquor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse, I'm afraid, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington told of his experience with the opium pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's no good whatever for a toothache, sir,\" growled Dr. Mackenzie.\n",
      "\"Besides, it's a serious breach of discipline. I shall have to report\n",
      "you, Mr. Pennington.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I expected it, sir,\" replied Pennington meekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, the report won't cure your toothache,\" continued Dr. Mackenzie\n",
      "in a milder tone. \"We'll attend to that first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgeon busied himself with dissolving a drug in a small quantity of\n",
      "water. This he took up in a hypodermic needle and injected into the\n",
      "lower jaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ache ought to stop in ten minutes, sir,\" continued the surgeon,\n",
      "turning to enter some memoranda in his record book.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"However, I'll be on the quarter-deck, and, if I'm wanted, you can send\n",
      "there for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, old man. You're worth a brigade of Darrins--confound the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Darrin acted according to his best lights on the subject of duty,\"\n",
      "remonstrated Mr. Hallam mildly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His best lights--bah!\" snarled Pennington. \"I'll take this all out of\n",
      "him before I'm through with him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington reported to the battleship's commander. After some ten\n",
      "minutes a marine orderly found Hallam and directed him to go to Captain\n",
      "Scott's office. Here Hallam repeated as much as was asked of him\n",
      "concerning the doings of the afternoon. Incidentally, the fact of\n",
      "Midshipman Darrin's report to the police was brought out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I shall send you at once, in a launch, over to the\n",

      "Captain Scott gravely. \"Mr. Hallam, you will go with Mr. Pennington.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, after the two had departed, an apprentice messenger went through\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am in possession of all the facts relating to the unfortunate affair\n",
      "of Midshipman Pennington, Mr. Darrin,\" began Captain Scott, after the\n",
      "interchange of salutes. \"Will you tell me why you reported the affair to\n",
      "the police?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went to the police, sir,\" Dave replied, \"because I was aware that\n",
      "many members of the new fourth class are away from home for the first\n",
      "time in their lives. I was afraid, sir, that possibly some of the new\n",
      "midshipmen might, during one of their town-leaves, be tempted to try for\n",
      "a new experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very excellent reason, Mr. Darrin, and I commend you heartily for it.\n",
      "I shall also report your exemplary conduct to the commandant of\n",
      "midshipmen. You have, in my opinion, Mr. Darrin, displayed very good\n",
      "judgment, and you acted upon that judgment with promptness and decision.\n",
      "But I am afraid,\" continued the Navy captain dryly, \"that you have done\n",
      "something that will make you highly unpopular, for a while, with some\n",
      "of the members of your class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not, sir,\" replied Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I,\" smiled Captain Scott \"I am willing to find myself a poor\n",
      "prophet. That is all, Mr. Darrin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more saluting, Dave left the commanding officer's presence. Almost\n",
      "the first classmate into whom he stumbled was Dan Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, from what quarter does the wind blow!\" murmured Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin repeated the interview that he had just had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid, Dave, little giant, that you've planted something of a mine\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I feel as much convinced as ever, Danny boy, that I did just what I\n",
      "should have done,\" replied Darrin seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so does Captain Scott, and so will the commandant,\" replied Dan.\n",
      "\"But winning the commendation of your superior officers doesn't always\n",
      "imply that you'll get much praise from your classmates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, you are quite right,\" smiled Dave. \"Still, I'd do the\n",
      "same thing over again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, of course you would,\" assented Dan. \"That's because you're Dave\n",

      "\n",
      "This order was repeated in other parts of the ship. Midshipmen gathered\n",
      "with a rush, Pennington and Hallam being the only members absent. As\n",
      "soon as the third classmen, or \"youngsters,\" as they are called in\n",
      "midshipman parlance, had formed, the orders were read off dividing them\n",
      "into sections for practical instruction aboard ship during the cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave's name was one of the first read off. He was assigned to duty as\n",
      "section leader for the first section in electrical instruction. Dalzell,\n",
      "Farley, Hallam, Pennington and others were detailed as members of that\n",
      "section.\n",

      "The same section was also designated for steam instruction, Dalzell\n",
      "being made leader of the section in this branch.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hallam at once sought out Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darry, old man,\" murmured Hallam, \"Pen is as crazy as a hornet against\n",
      "you. As he had taken the first step by sticking himself on the pap-sheet\n",
      "(placing himself on report), the commandant said he would make the\n",
      "punishment a lighter one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did Pen get?\" queried Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifty demerits, with all the loss of privileges that fifty carry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's lucky,\" declared Dave promptly. \"Had the report come from other\n",

      "There was hardly any need to do so. Pennington's face, flushed with\n",
      "mortification, was sufficient identification. But the chief electrician\n",
      "stepped over, halting in front of the hapless one, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the young gentleman, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your name, sir?\" demanded the officer.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, you will place yourself on the report, sir, for\n",

      "\"The only case, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer passed out of the dynamo room, leaving the unlucky one more\n",
      "than ever angry with Darrin, whom he incorrectly charged with his\n",
      "present trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recall sounding, Dave turned to Whittam, saying crisply but\n",
      "pleasantly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you for our instruction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's thanking the fellow for my new scrape,\" growled Pennington\n",
      "inwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave marched his section back to deck and dismissed it. Dan Dalzell, as\n",
      "section leader in steam instruction, immediately re-formed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will report in the engine-room, Mr. Dalzell, to\n",
      "Lieutenant-Commander Forman, who is chief engineer of this ship. He\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" Dan replied, saluting. \"Section, right wheel--march!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan already knew where, down in the bowels of the great battleship, to\n",
      "find the engine room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching that department, Dan halted his section.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Dalzell, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let your section break ranks. Then you may all follow me, and keep your\n",
      "eyes open, for you will go through one or two dark places.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir. Section break ranks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lieutenant-Commander Forman led the way, with all the members of the\n",
      "section wondering what was to be the nature of their first day's work in\n",
      "the engineer department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Descending lower into the ship, the chief engineer led the young middies\n",
      "over a grating, and paused at the head of an iron ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass down in orderly fashion, single file,\" directed the chief\n",
      "engineer, halting. \"When at the foot of this ladder, cross a grating to\n",
      "port side, and then descend a second ladder, which you will find.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All the midshipmen went down the first ladder in silence. Dan, who had\n",
      "preceded the others, crossed the grating and found the second ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more these youngsters descended. Pennington, as though by mere\n",
      "accident, succeeded in following Dave Darrin down the ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as they were near the bottom Dave felt a foot descend upon his\n",
      "shoulder, almost with a kick, and then rest there with a crushing\n",
      "pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It hurt keenly until Darrin was able to dodge out from under and\n",
      "hurriedly reach the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon, whoever you are,\" came a gruff voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave, with his shoulder crippled a good deal, and paining keenly, halted\n",
      "as soon as his foot had touched bottom. It was dark down there, though\n",
      "some reflected light came from an incandescent light at a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave waited, to peer into the face of the man who had stepped on his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Pennington, of course!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take pains not to go down ahead of you again, or to follow you up\n",
      "a ladder,\" grunted Darrin suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, are you the man on whose shoulder my foot rested?\" asked\n",
      "Pennington, with apparent curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't you know it!\" questioned Darrin, looking straight into the\n",
      "other's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of answering intelligibly, Pennington turned and walked away a\n",
      "few feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps that fellow thinks he's going to vent his spite on me in a lot\n",
      "of petty ways,\" murmured Dave. \"If that is the idea he has in his head,\n",
      "he's going to wake up one of these days!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the last midshipman came Lieutenant-Commander Forman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After me, gentlemen,\" directed the chief engineer. He turned down a\n",
      "narrow passage, only a few feet long, and came out in the furnace room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here huge fires glowed through the furnace doors. Four of the Navy's\n",
      "firemen stood resting on their shovels. Instantly, on perceiving the\n",
      "chief engineer, however, the men stood at attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass the word for the chief water tender,\" ordered the engineer,\n",
      "turning to one of the firemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The messenger soon came back with a pleasant-faced, stalwart man of\n",
      "forty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heistand,\" ordered the chief engineer, \"give these members of the first\n",
      "section, third: class, steam instruction, a thorough drill in firing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied the chief water tender, saluting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heistand's orders are mine, Mr. Dalzell,\" continued the\n",
      "lieutenant-commander, facing Dan. \"Preserve order in your section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied Dan, saluting. Acknowledging this courtesy in\n",
      "kind, the chief engineer turned and left the furnace room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heistand was presumably of German parentage, though he had no accent. He\n",
      "struck the midshipmen as being a pleasant, wholesome fellow, though the\n",
      "water tenders and firemen of the \"Massachusetts\" knew that he could be\n",
      "extremely strict and grim at need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will now, young gentlemen,\" began Heistand, \"proceed to learn all\n",
      "about priming a furnace, lighting, building, cleaning and generally\n",
      "taking care of a fire. Two furnaces have been left idle for this\n",
      "instruction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But two of the regular firemen now remained in the room. These were\n",
      "ordered to hustle out coal before boilers B and D. Then Heistand taught\n",
      "the members of the section how to swing a shovel to the best advantage\n",
      "so as to get in a maximum of coal with the least effort. He also\n",
      "illustrated two or three incorrect ways of shoveling coal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea of making coal heavers out of us!\" growled a much-disgusted\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan did not see who the speaker was, but his eyes flashed as he turned\n",
      "and rasped out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence in the section! Speak only to ask for information, and then at\n",
      "the proper time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another young autocrat!\" muttered a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait one moment, please, Heistand,\" begged Dan. Then, wheeling squarely\n",
      "about, and facing all the members of the section, he declared with\n",
      "emphasis:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's any more unauthorized talking I shall feel obliged to pass\n",
      "the word above that discipline is in a bad way in this section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he wheeled about once more, facing the chief water tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, young gentlemen,\" resumed the chief water tender, \"take your\n",
      "shovels and fill in lively under boilers B and D.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three or four times Heistand checked one or another of the midshipmen,\n",
      "to show him a more correct way of handling the shovel. Yet, in good\n",
      "time, both furnaces were primed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Dalzell, please detail four members of the section to follow\n",
      "me with their shovels and bring red coals from under another boiler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan appointed himself, Darrin, Farley and Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning coals were brought and thrown into each furnace, and in a little\n",
      "while roaring fires were going. These, though not needed for the\n",
      "handling of the battleship, were permitted to burn for a while,\n",
      "Heistand explaining to the section practically the uses of the water\n",
      "gauges and the test cocks. By this time the midshipmen's white working\n",
      "clothes were liberally sprinkled with coal dust and somewhat smeared\n",
      "with oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, young gentlemen, as we have no further use for these fires,\n",
      "you will next learn how to haul them,\" announced Heistand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was interesting work, but hot and fast. The implements with which\n",
      "the middies worked soon became red-hot at the end. Yet, as all entered\n",
      "into this novel work with zest, the fires had soon been hauled out on to\n",
      "the floor plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the last of this work was being done Pennington, as an apparent\n",
      "accident due to excess of zeal, dropped the red-hot end of his implement\n",
      "across the toe of Darrin's left shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant the leather began to blaze. With swift presence of mind\n",
      "Dave stepped his right foot on the flame, smothering it at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was \"mad clean through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Pen,\" he muttered, in a low voice, his eyes blazing fiercely\n",
      "into the other midshipman's, \"that is the last piece of impudence that\n",
      "will be tolerated from you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Midshipman Pennington's lip curled disdainfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan had not seen the \"accident,\" but he was near enough to hear the\n",
      "talking, and he caught Dave at it. So Dan ordered, impartially:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin, you will place yourself on report for unauthorized talking\n",
      "in section!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave flushed still more hotly, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midshipman Dalzell now marched the section from the furnace room, and\n",
      "dismissed it. It was near noon, and would soon be time for the middies\n",
      "to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave hurried away, washed, changed his uniform, and then stepped away\n",
      "swiftly to place himself on the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was sorry to do that, old chum,\" murmured Dan, as he met Dave\n",
      "returning. \"But of course I couldn't play favorites. What made you so\n",
      "far forget yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A something that would have had the same effect on you,\" retorted Dave\n",
      "grimly. Thereupon he described Pennington's two underhanded assaults\n",
      "that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humph!\" muttered Dalzell. \"That fellow Pen is bound to go the whole\n",
      "limit with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't go much further,\" declared Dave, his eyes flashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the chump ought to know it, too,\" mused Dan. \"The class history of\n",
      "the last year should have taught him that. But see here, Dave, I don't\n",
      "believe Pen will do anything openly. He will construct a series of\n",
      "plausible accidents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There will be one thing about him that will be open, if he goes any\n",
      "further,\" retorted Dave, \"and that will be his face when he collides\n",
      "with my fist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I see that when it happens,\" grinned Dalzell. \"It's bound to be\n",
      "entertaining!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a second, then. Here comes Pennington now,\" murmured Dave Darrin\n",
      "in an undertone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington, in his immaculate blue uniform, like the chums, came\n",
      "strolling along the passageway between decks.\n",
      "\n",
      "He affected not to see the chums, and would have passed by. But Dave,\n",
      "eyeing him closely, waited until Pen was barely three feet away. Then\n",
      "Darrin said tersely:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I wish an understanding with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want any with you,\" replied Pennington insolently, as he stared\n",
      "at Dave from under much-raised eyebrows. He would have gone by, but Dave\n",
      "sprang squarely in front of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just wait a moment!\" warned Dave rather imperiously, for he was aglow\n",
      "with justifiable indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" demanded Pennington halting. \"Out with it, whatever you may\n",
      "think you have to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have two things to speak about,\" replied Dave, trying to control his\n",
      "voice. \"In the first place, while going down the ladders to the furnaces\n",
      "this morning, you stepped on my shoulder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" insisted Pennington coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The second thing you did was, when hauling the fires, to drop red-hot\n",
      "metal across one of my shoes, setting it on fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" insisted Pennington more coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean to contend that either one was an accident,\" resumed Dave,\n",
      "\"then--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found himself obliged to pause for a moment in order to steady\n",
      "his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" asked Pennington with more insolence than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you make such pretense in either case,\" tittered Dave Darrin, \"then\n",
      "you're a liar!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fellow!\" sputtered Pennington, turning white with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean what I say, and I can back it up,\" muttered Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll make you eat your words!\" roared Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clenching his fists and with the boxer's attitude, Pen aimed two swift\n",
      "blows at Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither blow reached, however, for Dave dodged out of the way. Then\n",
      "Darrin struck back, a straight, true, forceful blow that landed on the\n",
      "other midshipman's nose, knocking him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington staggered somewhat when he rose, but he was quickly up, none\n",
      "the less, and ready for anything that might happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of a sudden Dan Dalzell felt his own heart going down into his\n",
      "shoes. One of the ship's officers had just entered the passageway, in\n",
      "time to see what was going on.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Stand at attention, ready to salute the officer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington, with the blood flowing from his damaged nose, would have\n",
      "made a most ludicrous figure saluting!\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant that he saw such evidence as Pen's nose presented the\n",
      "officer would be bound to make inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, just as surely, his next step must be to Border the three before\n",
      "the commandant of midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting carries with it a severe penalty. Even Dan was certain to be\n",
      "reported, through the mere fact of his presence there, as aiding in a\n",
      "fight. And those who aid are punished as severely as the principals\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a tense, fearsome instant, for midshipmen have been dismissed\n",
      "from the Naval Academy for this very offense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage was not brilliantly lighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The on-coming officer, a lieutenant, junior grade, was looking at the\n",
      "floor as he came along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he paused, seemed lost in thought, then wheeled and walked\n",
      "back whence he had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan breathed more easily. Dave heaved a sigh of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Pennington, that midshipman had wheeled and was stealing rapidly\n",
      "down the passageway, intent only on escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was the closest squeak we'll ever have without being ragged cold,\"\n",
      "murmured Dalzell tremulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Pennington?\" demanded Dave, wheeling about after he had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ducked out of sight, like a submarine,\" chuckled Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the call for midshipmen's dinner formation sounded. Dave\n",
      "and Dan were ready.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the middies haven't changed a lot since I boned at Annapolis!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington's nose was no very lovely member of his face at that moment.\n",
      "It had been struck hard, mashed rather flat, and now looked like a red\n",
      "bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meet with an accident, Pen?\" asked Hallam curiously at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quit your kidding, please,\" requested Pennington sulkily.\n",
      "\n",
      "That directed the curious glances of other middies at Pennington's new\n",
      "bulbous nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was so brusque about it, however, that other table mates\n",
      "ceased quizzing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, as soon as the meal was over, many a youngster asked others of his\n",

      "\n",
      "During the brief rest that followed the meal, however, Midshipman\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course, Mr. Darrin,\" began the other midshipman, in a voice\n",

      "cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe there's any danger of that,\" retorted Darrin, with an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Confound you, sir,\" hissed the other midshipman, \"don't you dare to be\n",
      "insolent with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I had thought,\" observed Dave, \"that, of your own choice, the\n",
      "period of courtesies between us had passed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall call you out, Mr. Darrin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll find my hearing excellent,\" smiled Dave. \"I shall make but one\n",
      "stipulation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do you the favor of asking what that stipulation is,\" sneered\n",
      "Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, after the narrow escape we had from being caught and reported, an\n",
      "hour or so ago, I shall ask that the fight be held where we are not so\n",
      "likely to be caught at it. I don't care about being dropped from the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes! Oh, well, you can easily procure writing materials from the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to get out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more do I,\" rejoined Dave. \"I won't even toss pennies with you to\n",
      "find out who quits the service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin, you are merely seeking to divert my mind from what I have\n",
      "said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you say--particularly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you would have to fight me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already signified my entire willingness, Mr. Pennington. To that\n",
      "I really can add nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth classmen are always addressed as \"mister,\" and they must use the\n",
      "same \"handle to the name\" when addressing upper classmen. But members of\n",
      "the three upper classes resort to the use of \"mister,\" in addressing\n",
      "classmates, only when they wish to be offensive or nearly so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will send a friend to meet you,\" Pennington continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I thought,\" bantered Darrin ironically, \"that you were going to\n",
      "fight me yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am--be sure of it. I will amend my statement by saying that I will\n",
      "send a second to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Save time by sending him to Dalzell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, Mr. Darrin.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "With two very stiff nods the midshipmen parted.\n",

      "Pennington hastened at once in search of Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you serve me, old man?\" queried Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry, but----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you see, Pen, not knowing all the facts of the case, I must admit\n",
      "that all my sympathies are with Darrin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All your sympathies?\" echoed Pen, frowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, nearly all, anyway. You see, I've known and observed Darrin for a\n",
      "full year now, and I don't believe patient old Darry is the one to start\n",
      "any trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He called me a liar,\" protested Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he?\" gasped Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he qualified the statement, but his way of saying it was as\n",
      "offensive as the direct lie could have been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you're bent on fighting Darry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad!\" muttered Hallam, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you anxious for your idol?\" asked Pen in a disagreeable tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Penny; it's you that I'm concerned about in my own mind. You're\n",
      "going next to a very hard proposition. Darry is patient--almost as\n",
      "patient as the proverbial camel--but when he fights he fights! You'll be\n",
      "hammered to a pulp, Pen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooh!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"And you think you're It?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As far as Darrin is concerned--yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad--too bad!\" sighed Hallam. \"I'm afraid, Penny, that the heat in\n",
      "the furnace room was too much for you this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you won't serve as one of my seconds?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The honor is most regretfully declined,\" replied Hallam in a tone of\n",

      "\"You want to see Darrin win?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there has to be a fight, I do,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.\n",

      "\"Don't bet your money on him, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not a gambler, Penny, and I don't bet,\" replied Hallam, with a\n",
      "dignity that, somehow, ended the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington had considerable difficulty, at first, in finding a second.\n",
      "At last, however, he induced Decker and Briggs to represent him.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two midshipmen went to see Dan Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait until I send for Mr. Farley,\" proposed Dalzell. He soon had that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This forenoon Pennington deliberately stepped on Darrin's shoulder,\n",
      "with such force as to lame it a good deal,\" replied Dan. \"Our man\n",
      "insists that he has a right to rest his shoulder, and to wait until\n",
      "to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But to-morrow we have a short shore liberty at Hampton Roads,\"\n",
      "remonstrated Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and during that shore liberty we can have the fight more safely\n",

      "Decker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll find plenty of pleasure, if you accept our proposition,\" urged\n",
      "Dan dryly. \"At any rate, we won't hear of Darrin fighting before\n",
      "to-morrow. He must have to-night to rest that shoulder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right; so be it,\" growled Decker, after a side glance at Briggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On shore, at some point to be selected by the seconds?\" asked Dan\n",
      "Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; that's agreed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Details as to whom to invite as referee and time-keeper were also\n",
      "arranged.\n",

      "\"There's one way you can save the day,\" grinned Decker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put Darrin to sleep in the first round, then hurriedly dress and leave,\n",
      "and enjoy your time on shore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Darrin is a very able man with his fists,\" observed Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but you're a mile bigger and heavier, and you're spry, too. You\n",
      "ought to handle him with all the ease in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" muttered Pennington, who didn't intend to make the\n",
      "mistake of bragging in advance. \"I'll do my best, of course.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The place\" turned out to be a barn that had not been used for a year or\n",

      "not to mention the affair to any one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you like it, Darry?\" asked Dan anxiously.\n",

      "\"Time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men had their guards up. As the word left the referee's lips each\n",
      "tried two or three passes which the other blocked. Midshipman Pennington\n",
      "was trying to take his opponent's \"measure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dave ducked, darted, dodged and wheeled about. Pennington had to\n",
      "follow him, and it made the latter angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand up and fight, can't you,\" hissed Pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence during the rounds, Mr. Pennington,\" admonished the referee\n",
      "quietly. \"Let the officials do all the talking that may be necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave, as he dodged again, and came up unscathed, grinned broadly over\n",

      "done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll wipe that grin off his face!\" muttered Pennington angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this very thing Pennington tried hard to do. He was quick on his own\n",
      "feet, and for a few seconds he followed the dodging Darrin about,\n",
      "raining in blows that required all of Dave's adroitness to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave's very success, however, made his opponent all the angrier. From\n",
      "annoyance, followed by excessive irritation, Pennington went into almost\n",
      "blind rage--and the man who does that, anywhere in life, must always pay\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Dave swung his right in on the point of Pen's chin with a force\n",
      "that jolted the larger midshipman. As part of the same movement,\n",
      "Darrin's left crashed against Pennington's nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, out of chivalry, Dave dropped back, to give Pen a few moments, in\n",
      "case he needed them, to get his wits back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time!\" roared Dawley, and Pennington's seconds pounced upon him and\n",
      "bore him away to his corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I know how that fellow Darrin wins his fights,\" growled Pennington\n",
      "in an undertone. \"He keeps on running away until he has the other man\n",
      "gasping for breath. Then Darrin jumps in and wins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The method doesn't much matter,\" commented Briggs dryly, as he and\n",
      "Decker worked over their man. \"It's the result that counts. Rush Darry\n",
      "into a tight corner, Pen, and then slam him hard and sufficiently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks, fellows; now I'm all right for the second round.\" muttered\n",
      "Midshipman Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few seconds more Dave and his opponent were hard at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave still used his footwork, and most cleverly. Yet, wherever he went,\n",
      "Pen followed him nimbly. It didn't look so one sided now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Pennington, at last, managed to deliver one blow on Darrin's right\n",
      "short ribs. It took a lot of Dave's spare wind; he raced about, seeking\n",
      "to regain his wind before allowing close quarters. But at last\n",
      "Pennington closed in again, and, after a swift feint, tried to land the\n",
      "same short-rib blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin was watching, and blocked. Then, his temples reddening with\n",
      "anger, Dave swung in a huge one that crashed in under Pennington's right\n",
      "ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time!\" shouted Dawley, just as Pen went to the floor in a heap. That\n",
      "saved the larger midshipman from having to take the count. His seconds\n",
      "had him ready at the call for the third round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, suddenly, Darrin seemed to change not only his tactics, but his\n",
      "whole personality. To his opponent Dave seemed suddenly transformed into\n",
      "a dancing demon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about the same old footwork, but it was aggressive now, instead\n",
      "of being defensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Dave landed a light tap on the already suffering nose. A few\n",
      "seconds later he landed on the point of Pen's chin, though not hard\n",
      "enough to send his man down. Then a rather light blow on the jaw, just\n",
      "under Pen's right ear again. The larger midshipman was now thoroughly\n",
      "alarmed. He feared that Darrin could do whatever he willed, and shivered\n",
      "with wonder as to when the knockout blow would come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, Pennington was still putting up a better battle than he\n",
      "himself realized, and Darrin was not disposed to take any foolish\n",
      "chances through rushing the affair. Thus, the third round ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that they came up for the fourth round, after both men had\n",
      "undergone some vigorous handling by their respective seconds, Pennington\n",
      "was a good deal revived and far more confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave's tactics were the same in the fourth round. Pennington didn't find\n",
      "time to develop much in the way of tactics for himself, save to defend\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first minute no important blows were landed on either side.\n",
      "Then, suddenly, Dave darted in and under, and brought a right-arm hook\n",
      "against Pen's nose in a way that started that member to bleeding again,\n",
      "and with a steady flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "That jarred the larger midshipman. He plunged in, heavily and blindly,\n",
      "blocking one of Darrin's blows by wrapping both arms around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of that, Mr. Pennington! Break away fast!\" ordered Midshipman\n",
      "Remington quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave took a fair get away, not attempting to strike as the clinch was\n",
      "broken. But an instant later Dave came back, dancing all around his\n",
      "dazed opponent, landing on the short ribs, on the breast bone, under\n",
      "either ear and finally on the tip of the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pen was sure that none of these blows had been delivered with the force\n",
      "that Darrin could have sent in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time!\" shouted Midshipman Dawley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principals retired to their corners, Pennington almost wholly afraid\n",
      "from the conviction that his antagonist was now merely playing with him\n",
      "to keep the interest going.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Pennington was still rather badly scared when the two came together\n",
      "for the fifth round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get lively, now, gentlemen, if you can,\" begged Referee Remington.\n",
      "\"Finish this one way or the other, and let us get some of the benefits\n",
      "of our shore leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pen started by putting more steam behind every blow. Dave, who had used\n",
      "up so much of his wind by his brilliant footwork, began to find it\n",
      "harder to keep the upper hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice, however, he managed to land body blows. He was trying to drive in\n",
      "a third when Pennington blocked, following this with a left-arm jab on\n",
      "Darrin's left jaw that sent the lighter man to the floor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"--seven, eight, nine, te----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave was up on his feet. Pen tried to make a quick rush, but Darrin\n",
      "dodged cleverly, them wheeled and faced his opponent as the latter\n",
      "wheeled about.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that there was less footwork. Both men stood up to it, as keenly\n",
      "alert as they could be, each trying to drive home heavy blows. While\n",
      "they were still at it the call of time sounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let him put it over you, David, little giant!\" warned Dan, as the\n",
      "latter and Farley vigorously massaged Darrin's muscles. \"He all but had\n",
      "you, and there isn't any need of making Pen a present of the meeting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tried to get him,\" muttered Dave in an undertone, \"and I shall go on\n",
      "trying to the last. But Pennington is pretty nearly superior to anyone\n",
      "in my class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just waltz in and show him,\" whispered Dalzell, as the call sounded.\n",
      "\n",

      "the outset, to drive in heavy blows, nor did Dave do much dodging.\n",

      "Bump! Twenty-five seconds only of this round had gone when Darrin landed\n",

      "sprayed, then rubbed Dave's chest and arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe, but I'm not so sure of that,\" rejoined Darrin. \"That fellow\n",

      "From Hampton Roads the Battleship Squadron, with the midshipmen on\n",

      "\n",
      "During most of the voyage over slow cruising speed was used. By the time\n",
      "that England's coast was sighted the third-class middies found they knew\n",
      "much more about a battleship than they had believed to be possible at\n",
      "the start of the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had served as firemen; they had mastered many of the electrical\n",
      "details of a battleship; they had received instruction and had \"stood\n",
      "trick\" by the engines; there had been some drill with the smaller,\n",
      "rapid-fire guns, and finally, they had learned at least the rudiments of\n",
      "\"wig-wagging,\" as signaling by means of signal flags is termed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just before the call to supper formation when England's coast\n",
      "loomed up. Most of the midshipmen stood at the rail, watching eagerly\n",
      "for a better glimpse at the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the midshipmen, especially those who came from wealthier\n",
      "families, had been in England before entering the Naval Academy. These\n",
      "fortunate ones were questioned eagerly by their comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battleships were well in sight of Eastern King Point when the\n",
      "midshipmen's call for supper formation sounded. Feeling that they would\n",
      "much have preferred to wait for their supper, the young men hastened\n",
      "below.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the line was formed it seemed to the impatient young men as though\n",
      "it had never taken so long to read the orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there came one welcome order, to the effect that, immediately after\n",
      "the morning meal, all midshipmen might go to the pay officer and draw\n",
      "ten dollars, to be charged against their pay accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ten dollars apiece looms up large David, little giant,\" murmured\n",
      "Dan Dalzell, while the evening meal was in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We ought to have a lot of fun on it,\" replied Darrin, who was looking\n",
      "forward with greatest eagerness to his first visit to any foreign soil.\n",
      "\"But how much shore leave are we to have?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two days, the word is. We'll get it straight in the morning, at\n",

      "\n",
      "In defiance of regulations, Midshipman Pennington, whose father was\n",
      "wealthy, had several hundred dollars concealed in his baggage. He had\n",
      "already invited Hallam, Mossworth and Dickey to keep in his wake on\n",
      "shore, and these young men had gladly enough agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, but we're slackening speed!\" quivered Dalzell, when the meal was\n",
      "nearly finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Headway has stopped,\" declared Darrin a few moments later.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rising in his place, Dan raised his hand aloft, and brought it down, as\n",

      "\n",
      "Three times this was done, each time the lips of the midshipmen forming\n",
      "a silent cheer.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ugh-h-h!\" groaned Midshipman Reilly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Then the midshipmen turned their attention to the remnants of the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boom! sounded sharply overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There goes the twenty-one-gunner,\" announced Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a foreign battleship enters a fortified port the visiting fleet, or\n",
      "rather, its flagship, fires a national salute of twenty-one guns. After\n",
      "a short interval following the discharge of the last gun, one of the\n",
      "forts on shore answers with twenty-one guns. This is one of the methods\n",
      "of observing the courtesies between nations by their respective fleets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere all the guns had been fired from the flagship, the third classmen\n",
      "received the rising signal; the class marched out and was dismissed.\n",
      "Instantly a break was made for deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The midshipmen were in good time to see the smoke and hear the roar of\n",
      "guns from one of the forts on shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning the commandant of cadets, as commanding officer of the\n",
      "squadron, would go ashore with his aide and pay a formal call to the\n",
      "senior military officer. Later in the day that English officer and one\n",
      "or two of his staff officers would return the call by coming out to the\n",
      "flagship. That accomplished, all the required courtesies would have been\n",
      "observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was still broad daylight, for in summer the English twilight is a\n",
      "long one, and darkness does not settle down until late.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if we were only going ashore to-night!\" murmured Hallam. There were\n",
      "many others to echo the thought, but all knew that it could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't we find a trick for slipping ashore after lights out?\"\n",
      "eagerly queried Dickey, who was not noted as a \"greaser.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could we?\" quivered Hallam, who, with few demerits against him, felt\n",
      "inclined to take a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Pennington, to whom he appealed, shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too big a risk, Hally,\" replied Pen. \"And trebly dangerous, with that\n",
      "greaser, Darrin, in the class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stow that,\" growled Hallam. \"Darrin is no greaser. You've got him\n",
      "on your black books--that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a greaser, I tell you,\" cried Pennington fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a score of midshipmen in this group, and many of them nodded\n",
      "approvingly at Pennington's statement. Though still a class leader, Dave\n",
      "had lost some of his popularity since his report to the police of\n",
      "Annapolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the middies turned in, that night, with unsatisfied dreams of shore\n",
      "life in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after breakfast the next morning, however, every midshipman had\n",
      "drawn his ten dollars, even to Pennington, who had no use for such a\n",
      "trifling amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "As fast as possible the launches ranged alongside at the side gangway,\n",
      "taking off groups of midshipmen, everyone of whom had been cautioned to\n",
      "be at dock in time to board a launch in season for supper formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington and his party were among the first to land. They hurried\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the second trip of one of the launches that Dave, Dan and\n",
      "Farley made their get away. These three chums had agreed to stick\n",
      "together during the day. They landed at the Great Western Docks, to find\n",
      "themselves surrounded by eager British cabbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are we going to take a cab and get more quickly and intelligently to\n",
      "the best part of the town to see?\" asked Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't vote for it,\" replied Darrin. \"We have only five dollars apiece\n",
      "for each of the two days we're to be ashore. I move that we put in the\n",
      "forenoon, anyway, in prowling about the town for ourselves. We'll learn\n",
      "more than we would by riding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, then,\" approved Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plymouth is an old-fashioned English seaport that has been rather famous\n",
      "ever since the thirteenth century. Many parts of the town, including\n",
      "whole streets, look as though the houses had been built since that time.\n",
      "This is especially true of many of the streets near the water front.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two hours the three middies roamed through the streets, often\n",
      "meeting fellow classmen. Wherever the young midshipmen went many of the\n",
      "English workmen and shopkeepers raised their hats in friendly salute of\n",
      "the American uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't seem to run across Pen's gang anywhere,\" remarked Farley at\n",
      "last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" smiled Dave. \"That's a capitalistic crowd. They'll hit only\n",
      "the high spots.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, these three poor-in-purse midshipmen enjoyed themselves\n",
      "hugely in seeing the quaint old town. At noon they found a real old\n",
      "English chop house, where they enjoyed a famous meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish we could slip some of these little mutton pies back with us!\"\n",
      "sighed Dan wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon the three chums saw the newer market place, where all\n",
      "three bought small souvenirs for their mothers at home. Darrin also\n",
      "secured a little remembrance present for his sweetheart, Belle Meade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guild hall and some of the other famous buildings were visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the afternoon Dave began to inspect his watch every two or\n",
      "three minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No need for us to worry, with Dave's eye glued to his watch,\" laughed\n",
      "Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, fellows,\" summoned Darrin finally. \"We haven't more than time\n",
      "now to make the dock and get back to supper formation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take a cab?\" asked Farley. \"You know, we've found that they're vastly\n",
      "cheaper than American cabs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No-o-o, not for me,\" decided Dave. \"We'll need the rest of our shore\n",
      "money to-morrow, and our legs are good and sturdy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even careful Dave, as it turned out, had allowed no more than time.\n",
      "The chums reached the dock in time to see the launches half way between\n",
      "the fleet and shore. Some forty other midshipmen stood waiting on the\n",
      "dock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among these were Pennington and his party, all looking highly satisfied\n",
      "with their day's sport, as indeed they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington's eyes gleamed when he caught sight of Darrin, Dalzell and\n",
      "Farley--for Pen had a scheme of his own in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from Pennington stood a little Englishman with keen eyes and a\n",
      "jovial face. Pen stepped over to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are the three midshipmen I was telling you about,\" whispered\n",
      "Pennington, slipping a half sovereign into the Englishman's hand. \"You\n",
      "thoroughly understand your part in the joke, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't h'I, though--just, sir!\" laughed the undersized Englishman, and\n",
      "strolled away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin and his friends were soon informed by classmates that the\n",
      "launches now making shore-ward were coming in on their last trip for\n",
      "midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we're here in plenty of time,\" sighed Dave contentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I knew we'd be, with you holding the watch,\" laughed Dan in his\n",
      "satisfied way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the three stood apart they were joined by the undersized Englishman,\n",
      "who touched his hat to them with a show of great respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young gentlemen,\" he inquired, \"h'I suppose, h'of course, you've 'ad a\n",
      "look h'at the anchor h'of Sir Francis Drake's flagship, the time 'e went\n",
      "h'out h'and sank the great Spanish h'Armada?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, no, my friend,\" replied Dave, looking at the man with interest.\n",
      "\"Is that here at Plymouth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'assuredly, sir. H'and h'only a minute's walk h'over to that shed\n",
      "yonder, sir. H'if you'll come with me, young gentlemen, h'I'll show h'it\n",
      "to you. H'it's one of h'our biggest sights, h'and it's in me own\n",
      "custody, at present. Come this way, young gentlemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds like something worth seeing,\" declared Dave to his\n",
      "comrades. \"Come along. It'll take the launches at least six minutes to\n",
      "get in, and then they'll stay tied up here for another five minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With only a single backward glance at the young midshipmen, the\n",
      "undersized Englishman was already leading the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At quickened pace the young midshipmen reached the shed that had been\n",
      "indicated. Their guide had already drawn a key from a pocket, and had\n",
      "unsnapped the heavy padlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Step right in, young gentlemen, h'and h'I'll follow h'and show h'it to\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsuspecting, the three middies stepped inside the darkened shed.\n",
      "Suddenly the door banged, and a padlock clicked outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, stop that, you rascally joker!\" roared Dalzell, wheeling about.\n",
      "\"What does this mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Big trouble!\" spoke Dave Darrin seriously and with a face from which\n",

      "\"The scoundrel!\" gasped Farley, his face whiter than any of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave was already at the door, trying to force it open. But he might\n",
      "almost as well have tried to lift one of the twelve-inch guns of the\n",
      "battleship \"Massachusetts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're locked in--that's sure!\" gasped Dalzell, almost dazed by the\n",
      "catastrophe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what's more, we won't get out in a hurry, unless we can make some\n",
      "of our classmates hear,\" declared Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next half minute they yelled themselves nearly hoarse, but no\n",
      "response came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What could have been that little cockney's purpose in playing this\n",
      "shabby trick on us?\" demanded Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps the cockney thinks we're admirals, with our pockets lined with\n",
      "gold. Perhaps he and some of his pals intend to rob us, later in the\n",
      "evening,\" proposed Dan, with a ghastly grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any gang would find something of a fight on their hands, then,\"\n",
      "muttered Dave Darrin grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three were equally at a loss to think of any explanation for such a\n",
      "\"joke\" as this. Equally improbable did it seem that any thugs of the\n",
      "town would expect to reap any harvest from robbing three midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desperately they turned to survey their surroundings. The shed was an\n",
      "old one, yet strongly built. There were no windows, no other door save\n",
      "that at which the three middies now stood baffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another good old yell,\" proposed Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was given with a lusty will, but proved as fruitless as the former\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't take the last launch back to ship,\" declared Farley, wild with\n",
      "rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which means a long string of demerits,\" said Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No shore leave to-morrow, either,\" groaned Darrin. \"Fellows, this\n",
      "mishap will affect our shore leave throughout all the cruise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can explain it,\" suggested Farley with a hopefulness that he did not\n",
      "feel at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course we can,\" jeered Dave Darrin. \"But what officer is fool enough\n",
      "to believe such a cock-and-bull story as this one will seem? At the very\n",
      "least, the commandant would believe that we had been playing some pretty\n",
      "stiff prank ourselves, in order to get treated in this fashion. No, no,\n",
      "fellows! We may just as well undeceive ourselves, and prepare to take\n",
      "the full soaking of discipline that we're bound to get. If we attempted\n",
      "this sort of explanation, we'd be lucky indeed to get through the affair\n",
      "without being tried by general court-martial for lying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drake's anchor, indeed!\" exclaimed Dan in deep self disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We ought to have known better,\" grunted Farley, equally enraged with\n",
      "himself. \"What on earth made us so absent-minded as to believe that a\n",
      "priceless relic would be kept in an old shed like this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're sure enough idiots!\" groaned Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on there, fellows,\" interrupted Dave Darrin. \"Vent all your anger\n",
      "right on me. I'm the great and only cause of this misfortune. It was I\n",
      "who proposed that we take up that cockney's invitation. I'm the real and\n",
      "only offender against decent good sense, and yet you both have to suffer\n",
      "with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's give another yell, bigger than before,\" suggested Dan weakly.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did, but with no better result than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The launches are away now, anyway, I guess,\" groaned Farley, after\n",
      "consulting his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and we're up the tree with the commandant,\" grunted Dalzell\n",
      "bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yell again?\" asked Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" retorted Dave, shaking his head. \"We've seen the uselessness of\n",
      "asking help from outside. Let's supply our own help. Now,\n",
      "then--altogether! Shoulder the door!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A savage assault they hurled upon the door. But they merely caused it to\n",
      "vibrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't do it,\" gasped Dan, after the third trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considerable daylight filtered in through the cracks at top, bottom and\n",
      "one side of the door. Further back in the shed there was less light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's explore this old place in search of hope,\" begged Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together they started back, looking about keenly in what appeared to be\n",
      "an empty room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say! Look at that!\" cried Dave suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed to a solid looking, not very heavy ship's spar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What good will that thing do us?\" asked Farley rather dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's see if we can raise it to our shoulders,\" proposed Dave Darrin\n",
      "radiantly. \"Then well find out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah!\" quivered Dan Dalzell, bending over the spar at the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up with it!\" commanded Darrin, placing himself at the head of the spar.\n",
      "Farley took hold at the further end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up with it!\" heaved Midshipman Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right up the spar went. It would have been a heavy job for three young\n",
      "men of their size in civil life, but midshipmen are constantly\n",
      "undergoing the best sort of physical training.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, then--a fast run and a hard bump!\" called Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door they rushed, bearing the spar as a battering ram.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bump! The door shook and shivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once more may do it!\" cheered Darrin. \"Back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again they dashed the head of their battering ram against the door. It\n",
      "gave way, and, climbing through, they raced back to the pier.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dan, who had secured the lead, stopped with a groan, pointing out\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Merciful powers!\" gasped Dan at last, as they rode half way up the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We may as well face it,\" muttered Dan brokenly. \"They don't believe\n",
      "that any of us has survived, and we've been abandoned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" spoke Dave Darrin very coolly, \"there's nothing left for us but\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It seems heartless, needless,\" protested Dan.\n",
      "\n",

      "searched for us--half a day, at least.\"\n",

      "\"Yes; the time has only seemed longer, I reckon,\" observed Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we'll face it like men,\" proposed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" nodded Dan. \"At least, we're going down in the ocean, and\n",
      "we wear the American Naval uniform. If there's any choice in deaths, I\n",
      "guess that's as good and manly a one as we could choose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor old Hally won't know much about it, anyway, I guess,\" remarked\n",
      "Darrin, who seemed unnaturally cool. Possibly he was a bit dazed by the\n",
      "stunning nature of the fate that seemed about to overtake them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe the ships will go by us in their final get-away,\" proposed Dan\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then there's no help for it,\" answered Dan, choking slightly. \"I wonder\n",
      "if we could do anything for Hallam?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We won't do anything to bring him to, anyway,\" muttered Darrin. \"Under\n",
      "these circumstances I wouldn't do anything as mean as that to a dog!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "All was now desolation over the angry sea, as the battleships gradually\n",

      "By the time that little more than the mastheads of the departing\n",

      "It would have seemed a vastly kinder fate had he been allowed to remain\n",
      "unconscious to the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallam had not been strangled by the inrush of water. In going\n",
      "overboard, this midshipman had struck the water with the back of his\n",

      "\n",
      "Even now the hapless midshipman whose frollicking had been the cause of\n",

      "\"Yes,\" assented Darrin, trying to speak cheerfully.\n",

      "\"How did it happen?\"\n",

      "\"Fell overboard,\" replied Dan laconically, failing to mention who it was\n",
      "who had fallen over the stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again a rather long silence on Hallam's part. Then, at last, he\n",
      "observed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Funny how we all fell over at the same time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this neither of his classmates made any rejoinder.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dan nodded without words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you fellows jumped in after me,\" roared Hallam, both his mental and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" assented Darrin rather reluctantly.\n",

      "heads above the big waves, and so----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They've gone away and left us?\" queried Hallam, guessing at once. \"Now,\n",
      "fellows, I don't mind so much for myself, but it's fearful to think that\n",
      "I've dragged you into the same fate. It's awful! Why couldn't you have\n",
      "left me to my fate?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you have done a thing like that?\" demanded Dave dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, I suppose not, but--but--well, I wish I had been left to pay\n",
      "the price of my tomfoolery all alone. It would have served me right. But\n",
      "to drag you two into it--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallam could go no further. He was choking up with honest emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't bother about it, Hally,\" urged Dave. \"It's all in the day's work\n",
      "for a sailor. We'll just take it as it comes, old fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To not one of the trio did it occur to let go of the life buoys and sink\n",
      "as a means of ending misery. In the first place, human instinct holds to\n",
      "hope. In the second place, suicide is the resort of cowards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of you happened to hide any food in his pockets at breakfast, I\n",

      "Of course they hadn't.\n",

      "be a delicacy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallam took no part in the chaffing. He was miserably conscious, all\n",
      "the while, that his own folly had been solely responsible for the\n",
      "present plight of these noble messmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the time passed on. None kept any track of it; they realized only\n",

      "cried Dave, his eyes kindling with hope.\n",

      "\"Don't get too excited over it,\" urged Dan. \"For my part, I'm growing\n",
      "almost accustomed to disappointments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the minutes passed and the liner came on and on, it looked still\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"Look! They See Us!\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, the craft was passing, showing her port side, not very\n",
      "far distant, to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uniting their voices, the three midshipmen yelled with all their power,\n",
      "even though they knew that their desperate call for help could not carry\n",
      "the distance over the subsiding gale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boom! That shot came from the liner, and now her port rail was black\n",
      "with people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They see us!\" cried Hallam joyously. \"Look! That craft is slowing up!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more came the cheers of encouragement, as the liner, now some\n",
      "distance ahead, put off a heavy launch. A masthead lookout, who had\n",
      "first seen the midshipmen, was now signaling the way to the officer in\n",
      "command of the launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unable to see for himself, the officer in the launch depended wholly on\n",
      "those masthead signals. So the launch steamed a somewhat zig-zag course\n",
      "over the waves. Yet, at last, it bore down straight upon the midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin, Dalzell and Hallam now came very near to closing their eyes, to\n",
      "lessen the suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short time more and all three were dragged in over the sides of the\n",
      "launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get those life buoys in, if you can,\" begged Dave, as he sank in the\n",
      "bottom of the launch. \"They are United States property entrusted to our\n",
      "care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From officer and seamen alike a laugh went up at this request, but the\n",
      "life buoys were caught with a boathook and drawn aboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "What rousing cheers greeted the returning launch, from the decks of the\n",
      "liner, \"Princess Irene\"! When the three midshipmen reached deck and it\n",
      "was learned that they were midshipmen of the United States Navy, the\n",
      "cheering and interest were redoubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the captain and the ship's doctor cut short any attempt at lionizing\n",
      "by rushing the midshipmen to a stateroom containing three berths. Here,\n",
      "under the doctor's orders, the trio were stripped and rubbed down. Then\n",
      "they were rolled into blankets, and hot coffee brought to them in their\n",
      "berths, while their wet clothing was sent below to one of the furnace\n",
      "rooms for hurried drying.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the medical man had examined them, the steamship's captain\n",
      "began to question them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Headed for the Azores, eh?\" demanded the ship's master. \"We ought to be\n",
      "able to sight your squadron before long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He hastened out, to give orders to the deck officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that the young midshipmen had been satisfactorily warmed,\n",
      "and their clothing had been dried, the ship's surgeon consented to their\n",
      "dressing. After this they were led to a private cabin where a satisfying\n",
      "meal was served them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" murmured Dan, leaning back, with a contented sigh,\n",
      "after the meal was over; \"there are worse things than what happened to\n",
      "us to-day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater speed of the liner enabled her to sight the battleship\n",
      "squadron something more than two hours afterward. Then the nearest\n",
      "vessel of the fleet was steered for directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck officers of the liner sent their heavy overcoats for the use of\n",
      "the midshipmen, who, enveloped in these roomy garments, went out on deck\n",
      "to watch the pursuit of their own comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within another hour it was possible to signal, and from the \"Princess\n",
      "Irene's\" masthead the signal flags were broken out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, watch for excitement on board your own craft,\" smiled the liner's\n",
      "commander, an Englishman.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the liner's signal had been read by the vessels of the\n",
      "squadron a wild display of signal bunting swiftly broke out.\n",

      "to receive her launch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes more the two vessels were close enough. Both stopped\n",

      "cynically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was pure accident,\" contended Pennington, paling. \"Until it happened\n",
      "I hadn't the least idea in the world that I was going to send Mr. Darrin\n",
      "or anyone else overboard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huh!\" returned Farley dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huh!\" quoth Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Dalzell uttered not a word, but the gaze of his eyes was fixed\n",
      "angrily on Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "That latter midshipman turned as white as a sheet. His hands worked as\n",
      "though he were attempting to clutch at something to hold himself up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely, you fellows don't believe, do you--\" he stammered weakly, then\n",
      "paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thing we did notice, the other day,\" continued Farley briskly, \"was\n",
      "that, when Darrin was rescued from the sea and returned to us, you were\n",
      "about the only member of the class who didn't go up to him and\n",
      "congratulate him on his marvelous escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I haven't the patience to talk with you now,\" rejoined\n",
      "Farley, turning on his heel.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the yell started among the midshipmen nearer the rail.\n",
      "Farley, Dan, Hallam and others joined in the yell and rushed to better\n",
      "points of vantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington tried to join in the cheer, but his tongue seemed fixed to\n",
      "the roof of his mouth. He stood clenching and unclenching his hands, his\n",
      "face an ashen gray in his deep humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care what one or two fellows may say,\" groaned Pennington.\n",
      "\"But I don't want the class to think such things of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the most miserable man on board as the small boat came alongside.\n",
      "The boat, occupants and all, was hoisted up to the davits and swung\n",
      "in-board. To the officer of the deck, who stood near-by, Dave turned,\n",
      "with a brisk salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg to report that I've come aboard, sir,\" Darrin uttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And very glad we are of it, Mr. Darrin,\" replied the officer. \"You will\n",
      "go to your locker, change your clothing and then report to the captain,\n",
      "sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With another salute, Dave hastened below, followed by Dan Dalzell, who\n",
      "was intent on attending him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes later Dave appeared at the door of the captain's cabin. Just\n",
      "a few minutes after that he came out on deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "A crowd gathered about him, expressing their congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you all,\" laughed Dave, \"but don't make so much over a middy\n",
      "getting a bath outside of the schedule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To the rear hung Pennington, waiting his chance. At last, as the crowd\n",
      "thinned, Pennington made his way up to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin, I have to apologize for my nonsense, which was the means\n",
      "of pushing you overboard. It was purely accidental, on my honor. I did\n",
      "not even know it was you at the stern, nor did I realize that my antics\n",
      "would result in pushing any one overboard. I trust you will do me the\n",
      "honor of believing my statement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I believe it, Mr. Pennington,\" answered Darrin, opening his\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some,\" continued Pennington, \"who have intimated to me their\n",
      "belief that I did it on purpose. There may be others who half believe or\n",
      "suspect that I might, or would, do such a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" retorted Dave promptly. \"There may be differences,\n",
      "sometimes, between classmates, but there isn't a midshipman in the Navy\n",
      "who would deliberately try to drown a comrade. It's a preposterous\n",
      "insult against midshipman honor. If I hear any one make a charge like\n",
      "that, I'll call him out promptly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of your friends--I won't name them--insisted, or at least let me\n",
      "feel the force of their suspicions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If any of my friends hinted at such a thing, it was done in the heat of\n",
      "the moment,\" replied Dave heartily. \"Why, Mr. Pennington, such an act of\n",
      "dishonor is impossible to a man bred at Annapolis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin fully believed what he said. On the spur of the moment he held\n",
      "out his hand to his enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington flushed deeply, for a moment, then put out his own hand,\n",
      "giving Dave's a hearty, straightforward grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was the first to imply the charge,\" broke in Farley quickly. \"I\n",
      "withdraw it, and apologize to both of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was more handshaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next few days, while Darry and Pen did not become by any\n",
      "means intimate, they no longer made any effort to avoid each other, but\n",
      "spoke frankly when they met.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining days of the voyage passed uneventfully enough, except for\n",
      "a great amount of hard work that the middies performed as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the twenty-second of August they entered Chesapeake Bay. Once well\n",
      "inside, they came to anchor. There was considerable practice with the\n",
      "sub-caliber and other smaller guns. On the twenty-ninth of August the\n",
      "battleship fleet returned to the familiar waters around Annapolis. The\n",
      "day after that the young men disembarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came a hurried skeltering, for the first, second and third classmen\n",
      "were entitled to leave during the month of September.\n",

      "\n",
      "Everyone in Gridley, it seemed, had read that newspaper story. Darrin\n",

      "\n",
      "On the first morning of his arrival home Dave Darrin went frankly and\n",

      "Dan, having no particular associations with the gentler sex, took a\n",

      "Dave was shown into the parlor at the Meade home. Soon after Belle came\n",
      "swiftly in, her face beaming with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but you're not in uniform!\" was her first disappointed comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" smiled Dave. \"I'm allowed every possible chance, for one month, to\n",
      "forget every detail of the big grind which for a short time I've left\n",
      "behind.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" begged Dave. \"You're a friend of mine, aren't you! Then don't\n",

      "newspapers in mind I wouldn't have the nerve to----But please let's not\n",
      "talk about it anymore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the two young people seated themselves and spent a delightful hour\n",
      "in talking over all that had befallen them both since they had last\n",
      "met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle, too, through Laura Bentley, had some much later news of the old\n",

      "This news, however, will be found in full in \"DICK PRESCOTT'S SECOND\n",

      "\"Can you get hold of Dan?\"\n",

      "\"No trouble about that. But keeping hold of him may be more difficult,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nothing could be better in the way of a plan,\" assented Dave. \"I'll pin\n",
      "Danny boy down to that. It would really seem like a slight on good old\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll go to the telephone, now, and tell her that we're coming,\" cried\n",
      "Belle, rising quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Laura is delighted,\" she reported, on her return to the room. \"But\n",
      "Dave, didn't you at least bring along a uniform, so that we could see\n",
      "what it looks like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't,\" replied Dave, soberly, then added, quizzically:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've seen the district messenger boys on the street, haven't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course; but what--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our uniforms look very much like theirs,\" declared Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I can't undertake to believe you,\" Belle pouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, anyway, you girls will soon have a chance to see our uniforms.\n",
      "Just as soon as our hops start, this fall, you and Laura will come down\n",
      "and gladden our hearts by letting us drag you, won't you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drag us?\" repeated Belle, much mystified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's middies' slang for escorting a pretty girl to a midshipman\n",
      "hop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have a lot of slang, then, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Considerable,\" admitted Dave readily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, then, is your slang for a pretty girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we call her a queen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a girl who is--who isn't--pretty!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gold brick,\" answered Dave unblushingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gold brick?\" gasped Belle. \"Dear me! 'Dragging a gold brick' to a hop\n",
      "doesn't sound romantic, does it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't,\" Darrin admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you have invited me--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our class hasn't started in with its course of social compliments\n",
      "yet,\" laughed Dave. \"Please go look in the glass. Or, if you won't\n",
      "believe the glass, then just wait and see how proud Dan and I are if we\n",
      "can lead you and Laura out on the dancing floor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what horrid slang!\" protested Belle. \"The idea of calling a homely\n",
      "girl a gold brick! And I thought you young men received more or less\n",
      "training in being gracious to the weaker sex.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do,\" Dave answered, \"as soon as we can find any use for the\n",
      "accomplishment. Fourth classmen, you know, are considered too young to\n",
      "associate with girls. It's only now, when we've made a start in the\n",
      "third class, that we're to be allowed to attend the hops at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why must you have to have such horrid names for girls who have not\n",
      "been greatly favored in the way of looks? It doesn't sound exactly\n",
      "gallant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, you know,\" laughed Dave, \"we poor, despised, no-account\n",
      "middies must have some sort of sincere language to talk after we get our\n",
      "masks off for the day. I suppose we like the privilege, for a few\n",
      "minutes in each day, of being fresh, like other young folks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your name for 'fresh' down at Annapolis!\" Belle wanted to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Touge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And for being a bit worse than touge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ratey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which did they call you?\" demanded Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave started, then sat up straight, staring at Miss Meade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see that your tongue hasn't lost its old incisiveness,\" he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not among my friends,\" Belle replied lightly. \"But I can't get my mind\n",
      "off that uniform of yours that you didn't bring home. What would have\n",
      "happened to you if you had been bold enough to do it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess I'd have 'frapped the pap,'\" hazarded Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what on earth is 'frapping the pap'?\" gasped Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's a brief way of telling about it when a midshipman gets stuck\n",
      "on the conduct report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to buy a notebook,\" asserted Belle, \"and write down and\n",
      "classify some of this jargon. I'd hate to visit a strange country, like\n",
      "Annapolis, and find I didn't know the language. And, Dave, what sort of\n",
      "place is Annapolis, anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's a suburb of the Naval Academy,\" Dave answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it dreadfully hard to keep one's place in his class there?\" asked\n",
      "Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the average fellow is satisfied if he doesn't 'bust cold,'\" Dave\n",
      "informed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious! What sort of explosion is 'busting cold'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that means getting down pretty close to absolute zero in all\n",
      "studies. When a fellow has the hard luck to bust cold the superintendent\n",
      "allows him all his time, thereafter, to go home and look up a more\n",
      "suitable job than one in the Navy. And when a fellow bilges----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" begged Belle. \"Wait!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She fled from the room, to return presently bearing the prettiest hat\n",
      "that Dave ever remembered having seen on her shapely young head. In one\n",
      "hand she carried a dainty parasol that she turned over to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the cruise?\" asked Darrin, rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going out to get that notebook, now. Please don't talk any more\n",
      "'midshipman' to me until I get a chance to set the jargon down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she stood there, such a pretty and wholesome picture, David Darrin\n",
      "thought he never before had seen such a pretty girl, nor one dressed in\n",
      "such exquisite taste. Being a boy, it did not occur to him that Belle\n",
      "Meade had been engaged for weeks in designing this gown and others that\n",
      "she meant to wear during his brief stay at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of?\" asked Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a pity it is that I am doomed to a short life,\" sighed Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A short life? What do you mean?\" Belle asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I'm going to be assassinated, the first hop that you attend at the\n",
      "Naval Academy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I'm a gold brick, am I?\" frowned Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--a--gold brick?\" stammered Dave. \"Why, you--oh, go look in the\n",
      "glass!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who will assassinate you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A committee made up from among the fellows whose names I don't write\n",

      "You can't dance with them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to,\" replied Belle, with a toss of her head. \"I'll\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Belle, there's something--\" he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious! Where? What?\" she cried, looking about her keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's something I want to say--must say,\" Dave went on with more of an\n",
      "effort than anyone but himself could guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, as we're going down the street,\" invited Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Wha-a-at?_\" choked Dave. \"Well, I guess not!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He faced her, resting both hands lightly on her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle, we were pretty near sweethearts in the High School, I think,\" he\n",
      "went on, huskily, but looking her straight in the eyes. \"At least, that\n",
      "was my hope, and I hope, most earnestly, that it's going to continue.\n",
      "Belle, I am a long way from my real career, yet. It will be five years,\n",
      "yet, before I have any right to marry. But I want to look forward, all\n",
      "the time, to the sweet belief that my schoolgirl sweetheart is going to\n",
      "become my wife one of these days. I want that as a goal to work for,\n",
      "along with my commission in the Navy. But to this much I agree: if you\n",
      "say 'yes' now, and find later that you have made a mistake, you will\n",
      "tell me so frankly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor boy!\" murmured Belle, looking at him fully. \"You've been a plebe\n",

      "Then there was a little more talk and--well, it's no one's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we're not so formally engaged,\" Belle warned him, \"that you can't\n",
      "write me and draw out of the snare if you wish when you're older. And\n",
      "I'm not going to wear any ring until you've graduated from the Naval\n",
      "Academy. Do you understand that, Mr. David Darrin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be as you say, either way,\" Dave replied happily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, let us get started, or we shan't get out on the street\n",
      "to-day,\" urged Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they passed out on the street, and no ordinarily observant person\n",
      "would have suspected them of being anything more than school friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being very matter-of-fact in some respects, Belle's first move was to go\n",
      "to a stationer's, where she bought a little notebook bound in red\n",
      "leather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave tried to pay for that purchase, but Belle forestalled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you allow me to make you that little gift?\" he asked in a\n",
      "low tone, when they had reached the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait,\" replied Belle archly. \"Some day you may find your hands full in\n",
      "that line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my instructors at Annapolis complimented me on having very\n",
      "capable hands,\" Dave told her dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The instructor in boxing?\" asked Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wonderfully delightful stroll that the middy and his sweetheart\n",
      "enjoyed that September forenoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Dave sighed, so pronouncedly that Belle shot a quick look of\n",
      "questioning at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tired of our understanding already?\" she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I was thinking how sorry I am for Danny boy! He doesn't know the\n",
      "happiness of having a real sweetheart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know he doesn't?\" asked Belle quickly. \"Does he tell you\n",
      "everything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but I know Danny's sea-going lines pretty well. I'd suspect, at\n",
      "least, if he had a sweetheart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure that you would?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes! By gracious! There's Danny going around the corner above at\n",
      "this very moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle had looked in the same instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and a skirt swished around the corner with him,\" declared Belle\n",
      "impressively. \"It would be funny, wouldn't it, if you didn't happen to\n",
      "know all about Dan Dalzell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early afternoon, however, the mystery was cleared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the street Dalzell had encountered Laura Bentley. Both were full of\n",
      "talk and questions concerning Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, at West\n",
      "Point, for which reason Dan had strolled home with Miss Bentley without\n",
      "any other thought, on the midshipman's part, than playing substitute\n",
      "gallant for his chum, Cadet Richard Prescott, U.S. Military Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A most delightful afternoon the four young people spent together at the\n",
      "Bentley home.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the forerunners of other afternoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle and Laura, however, were not able to keep their midshipmen to\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other girls, former students at the High School, arranged a series of\n",
      "affairs to which the four young people were invited.\n",

      "or chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan's happiest moments, on the other hand, were when he was engaged in\n",
      "hunting the old High School fellows, or such of them as were now at\n",
      "home. For many of them had entered colleges or technical schools. Tom\n",
      "Reade and Harry Hazelton, of the famous old Dick & Co., of High School\n",

      "\n",
      "Dan had a happy enough time of it, even though Dave's suspicion was true\n",
      "in that Dan had no sweetheart. That, however, was Dan's fault entirely,\n",
      "as several of the former High School girls would have been willing to\n",
      "assure him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since even the happiest times must all end so the latter part of\n",
      "September drew near.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the day when Dave and Dan met at the railway station. A host\n",

      "\n",

      "the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gridley was gone--lost to sight for another year. Dan was exuberant\n",
      "during the first hour of the journey, Dave unusually silent.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you heap!\" sighed Dan Dalzell dismally.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat in his chair, in their new quarters in Bancroft Hall, United\n",
      "States Naval Academy, gazing in mock despair at the pile of new books\n",
      "that he had just drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "These text-books contained the subjects in which a midshipman is\n",
      "required to qualify in his second academic year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Been through the books for a first look?\" called Dave from behind his\n",
      "own study table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of 'em,\" admitted Dalzell. \"I'm afraid to glance into the others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've looked in all of my books,\" continued Darrin, \"and I've just come\n",
      "to a startling conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm inclined to believe that I have received a complete set of\n",
      "text-books for the first and second classes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No such luck!\" grunted Dan, getting up and going over to his chum. \"Let\n",
      "me see if you got all the books I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Dave could prevent it, Dan started a determined over-tossing of\n",
      "the book pile. As he did so, Dan suddenly uncovered a photograph from\n",
      "which a fair, sweet, laughing face gazed up at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I beg a million pardons, Dave, old boy!\" cried Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't,\" came Dave's frank answer. \"I'm proud of that treasure and\n",
      "of all it means to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I'm glad for you, David, little giant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their hands met in hearty clasp, and that was all that was said on that\n",
      "subject at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, seriously,\" Dan grumbled on, after a while, \"I'm aghast at what an\n",
      "exacting government expects and demands that we shall know. Just look\n",
      "over the list--mechanical drawing and mechanical processes, analytical\n",
      "geometry, calculus, physics, chemistry, English literature, French and\n",
      "Spanish, integral calculus, spherical trigonometry, stereographic\n",
      "projection and United States Naval history! David, my boy, by the end of\n",
      "this year we'll know more than college professors do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aren't you getting a big head, Danny?\" queried Darrin, looking up with\n",
      "a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\" assented Dalzell, \"and I admit it. Why, man alive, one has to\n",
      "have a big head here. No small head would contain all that the Academic\n",
      "Board insists on crowding into it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that the chums had attended the first section recitations\n",
      "on the following day, their despair was increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy, I don't see how we are ever going to make it, this year,\" Dalzell\n",
      "gasped, while they were making ready for supper formation. \"We'll bilge\n",
      "this year without a doubt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's only one reason I see for hoping that we can get through the\n",
      "year with fair credit,\" murmured Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Others have done it, before us, and many more are going to do it this\n",
      "year,\" replied Dave slowly, as he laid comb and brush away and drew on\n",
      "his uniform blouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know men have gotten through the Naval Academy in years gone by,\"\n",
      "Dalzell agreed. \"But, the first chance that I have, I'm going to look\n",
      "the matter up and see whether the middies of old had any such fearful\n",
      "grind as we have our noses held to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we'll do it,\" declared Darrin confidently. \"I shall, anyway--for\n",
      "I've got to!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he was thinking of Belle Meade, and of her prospects in life\n",
      "as well as his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days went by, however, Dave and Dan became more and more dull of\n",
      "spirits. The grind was a fearful one. A few very bright youngsters went\n",
      "along all right, but to most of the third classmen graduation began to\n",
      "look a thousand years away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The football squad was out now and training in deadly earnest. There\n",
      "were many big games to be played, but most of all the middies longed to\n",
      "tow West Point's Army eleven into the port of defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their first year Dave and Dan had looked forward longingly to joining\n",
      "the gridiron squad. They had even practised somewhat. But now they\n",
      "realized that playing football in the second year at Annapolis must be,\n",
      "for them, merely a foolish dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm thankful enough if I can study day and night and keep myself up to\n",
      "2.5,\" confessed Darrin, as he and Dan chatted over their gridiron\n",
      "longings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-and-five tenths is the lowest marking, on a scale of four, that will\n",
      "suffice to keep a midshipman in the Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to reach 2.5 in some studies this month,\" groaned Dan. \"I\n",
      "know that much by way of advance information. The fates be thanked that\n",
      "we're allowed until the semi-ans to pick up. But the question is, are we\n",
      "ever going to pick up? As I look through my books it seems to me that\n",
      "every succeeding lesson is twice as hard as the one before it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Other men have gone through, every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And still other men have been dropped every year,\" Dalzell dolefully\n",
      "reminded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're among those who are going to stay,\" Dave contended stubbornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'm afraid we'll be among those who are dropped after Christmas\n",
      "and come back, next year, as bilgers,\" Dalzell groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, drop that!\" commanded Darrin, almost roughly. \"Remember one thing,\n",
      "Daniel little lion slayer! My congressman and your senator won't appoint\n",
      "us again, if we fail now. No talk of that kind, remember. We've got to\n",
      "make our standing secure within the next few weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the month was over the football games began in earnest on the\n",
      "athletic field. Darrin and Dalzell, however, missed every game. They\n",
      "were too busy poring over their text-books. Fortunately for them their\n",
      "drills, parades and gym. work furnished them enough exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of October found Darrin at or above 2.5 in only three studies.\n",
      "Dan was above 2.5 in two studies--below that mark in all others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a pity my father never taught me to swear,\" grumbled Dalzell, in\n",
      "the privacy of their room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stow that talk,\" ordered Darrin, \"and shove off into the deeper waters\n",
      "of greater effort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Greater effort?\" demanded Dan, in a rage. \"Why I study, now, every\n",
      "possible moment of the time allowed for such foolishness. And we can't\n",
      "run a light. Right after taps the electric light is turned off at the\n",
      "master switch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're wasting ninety seconds of precious time, now, in grumbling,\"\n",
      "uttered Dave, seating himself doggedly at his study table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got any money, Darry?\" asked Dalzell suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; are you broke?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am, and the next time I go into Annapolis I mean to buy some\n",
      "candles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't try that, Danny. Running a light is dangerous, and doubly so with\n",
      "candles. The grease is bound to drip, and to be found in some little\n",
      "corner by one of the discipline officers. It would be no use to study if\n",
      "you are going to get frapped on the pap continuously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after supper both midshipmen forfeited their few minutes of\n",
      "recreation, going at once back to their study tables. There they\n",
      "remained, boning hard until the brief release sounded before taps was\n",
      "due.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at the sound of the release there came a knock at the door.\n",
      "Farley and his roommate, Page, came bounding in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to say something, or I'll go daffy,\" cried Farley, rubbing his\n",
      "eyes. \"Fellows, did you ever hear of such downright abuse as the second\n",
      "year course of studies means?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is tough,\" agreed Dave. \"But what can we do about it, except fight\n",
      "it out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you make head or tail out of calculus?\" demanded Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" admitted Darrin, \"but I hope to, one of these days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Freeman, of the first class, poked his head in, after a soft\n",
      "knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this--a despair meeting?\" he called cheerily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" groaned Page. \"We're in a blue funk over the way recitations are\n",
      "going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, buck up, kiddies!\" called Freeman cheerily, as he crossed the\n",
      "floor. \"Youngsters always get in the doldrums at the beginning of the\n",
      "year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a first classman. When you were in the third class did you have\n",
      "all the studies that we have now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every one of them, sir,\" affirmed Midshipman Freeman gravely, though\n",
      "there was a twinkle in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did you come through the course easily?\" asked Page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not easily,\" admitted the first classman. \"There isn't anything at\n",
      "Annapolis that is easy, except the dancing. In fact, during the first\n",
      "two months very few of our class came along like anything at all. After\n",
      "that, we began to do better. By the time that semi-ans came around\n",
      "nearly all of us managed to pull through. But what seems to be the worst\n",
      "grind of all--the real blue paint?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Calculus!\" cried the four youngsters in unison.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, once you begin to see daylight in calculus it's just as easy as\n",
      "taking a nap,\" declared the first classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At present it seems more like suffering from delirium,\" sighed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the hard one for to-morrow?\" asked Freeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here it is, right here,\" continued Dave, opening his text-book. \"Here's\n",
      "the very proposition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The others crowded about, nodding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember that one,\" laughed Freeman lightly. \"Our class named it\n",
      "'sticky fly paper.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was rightly named,\" grumbled Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of you four youngsters see through it?\" demanded Midshipman\n",
      "Freeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to claim, sir, that you ever did?\" insisted Dan Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not only once, but now,\" grinned Mr. Freeman. \"You haven't been looking\n",
      "at this torturing proposition from the right angle--that's all. Now,\n",
      "listen, while I read it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we all know how it runs, Mr. Freeman,\" protested Page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless, listen, while I read it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the first classman read through the proposition that was torturing\n",
      "them he threw an emphasis upon certain words that opened their eyes\n",
      "better as to the meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, it works out this way,\" continued the first classman, bending over\n",
      "the disk and drawing paper and pencil toward him. \"In the first place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Freeman seemed to these youngsters like a born demonstrator. Within five\n",
      "minutes he had made the \"sticky fly paper\" problem so plain to them all\n",
      "that they glanced from one to another in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it does seem easy,\" confessed Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It sounds foolish, now,\" grinned Darrin. \"I'm beginning to feel ashamed\n",
      "of myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Freeman,\" protested Page, \"you've saved us from suicide, or some\n",
      "other gruesome fate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll drop in once in a while again,\" promised the first classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that will take time from your own studies,\" remonstrated Darrin\n",
      "generously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least. I won't come around before release. By the time a\n",
      "fellow reaches the first class, if he's going to graduate anyway, he\n",
      "doesn't have to study as hard as a youngster does. The man who reaches\n",
      "the first class has had all the habits of true study ground into him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin, Dalzell, Farley and Page were all in different sections in\n",
      "mathematics. When they recited, next day, it so happened that each was\n",
      "the man to have the \"sticky fly paper\" problem assigned to him by the\n",
      "instructor. Each of the quartette received a full \"4\" for the day's\n",
      "marking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you have any assistance with this problem, Mr. Darrin?\" asked\n",
      "Dave's instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; a member of the first class tried to make it plain to me last\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He appears to have succeeded,\" remarked the instructor dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, however, no discredit attached to having received proper\n",
      "assistance before coming into section.\n",

      "attempt at cheeriness. \"You mean well, but a fellow isn't reported\n",
      "deficient unless he's so far behind that the Board has his case settled\n",
      "in advance. From all I can hear it isn't once in a camel's age that a\n",

      "classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now, I want to think over that,\" confessed Freeman frankly. \"Of\n",
      "course, Dalzell's record, this term, is in black and white, and can't be\n",
      "gainsaid. It's just possible our young friend can put up some line of\n",
      "talk that will extend his time here, and perhaps enable him to pull\n",
      "through. It's a mighty important question, so I'll tell you what we'll\n",
      "do. Of course, the hop comes on for to-morrow night. Let me have until\n",
      "Sunday evening. Meanwhile I'll talk with some of the other fellows of my\n",

      "for you--if there's any possible way of finding one.\"\n",

      "either of the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan gulped hard, though he managed to conceal the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin, however, was ready with the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we're having pretty rough sailing, but we're both still in our\n",
      "class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which statement was wholly truthful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up at West Point,\" Laura continued, \"Dick told us that the first two\n",
      "years were the hardest for a man to keep his place. I fancy it's just\n",
      "about the same here, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just about,\" Dave nodded. \"The first two years are hardest because it\n",
      "takes all that time for a fellow to get himself keyed up to the gait of\n",
      "study that is required in the government academies. But won't you let us\n",
      "talk about something that's really pleasant, girls?\" Dave asked, with\n",
      "his charming smile. \"Suppose we talk about yourselves. My, but you girls\n",
      "are good to look at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the conversation was shifted to lighter subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Dan, in the joy of meeting two girl friends from home, began to be\n",
      "less conscious of his load of misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Mrs. Meade came down. She chatted with the two fine-looking\n",
      "young midshipmen for a few moments. Then Dave proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you like us to escort you through the Academy grounds, so that\n",
      "you can get a good idea of the place in daylight?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been waiting only for you to invite us,\" rejoined Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next two hours the time was passed pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Belle, behind all her light chatter, was unusually keen and\n",
      "observing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is anything wrong with either of you?\" she asked Dave suddenly, when\n",
      "this pair were out of easy hearing of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you ask that?\" inquired Dave, looking at her in his direct\n",
      "fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I may be unnecessarily sensitive, but I can't help feeling that\n",
      "some sort of disaster is hanging over either you or Dan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" replied Darrin evasively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave, that isn't a direct answer,\" warned Belle, raising her eyebrows.\n",
      "\"Do you consider me entitled to one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. What's the question?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you in any trouble here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm thankful to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then is Dan!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle, I'd rather not answer that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, because, if he is, I'd rather not discuss it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has Dan been caught in any scrape?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. His conduct record is fine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it must be failure in his studies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you tell me?\" insisted Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anything were in the wind, Belle, we'd rather not tell you and spoil\n",
      "your visit. And don't ask Dan anything about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I know enough,\" went on Belle thoughtfully and\n",
      "sympathetically. \"Poor Dan! He's one of the finest of fellows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are no better made,\" retorted Dave promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anything happens to Dan here, dear, I know you will feel just as\n",
      "unhappy about it as if it happened to yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mighty close to it,\" nodded Darrin. \"But it would be a double\n",
      "heartbreak for me, if I had to leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On account of the future I've planned for you, Belle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you silly boy, then!\" Belle answered, smiling into his eyes. \"I\n",
      "believe I have half committed myself to the idea of marrying you when\n",
      "you've made your place in life. But it was Dave Darrin to whom I gave\n",
      "that half promise--not a uniform of any sort. Dave, if anything ever\n",
      "happens that you have to quit here, don't imagine that it's going to\n",
      "make a particle of difference in our understanding.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "to be reassured once in a while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a great fellow Dan is!\" exclaimed Belle a few minutes later. \"See\n",

      "\n",
      "Many a young man, doomed to be sent forth from a Naval career, back into\n",
      "the busy, unheeding world, had faced this Board in times past. So it was\n",

      "\n",
      "This the brigade adjutant did rapidly, and in perfunctory tones.\n",

      "\"Why--\"\n",
      "\n",

      "kind of an act of gratitude would it be for you to make your first act a\n",
      "breach of discipline? For a fight, though often necessary here, is in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You will be this time, Danny. Don't worry about it, either. Farley and\n",

      "You behaved fairly at every point.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The verdict was also fair enough,\" Dave continued, \"for I am aware that\n",
      "I took a hair's-breadth more than the count. Still, I do not feel, Mr.\n",
      "Treadwell, that the result was decisive. Therefore I have to ask of you\n",
      "the favor of another early meeting, for a more definite try-out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Treadwell gasped. So did his recent seconds and the late officials of\n",

      "\"I'll get the fellow going quickly this time,\" Mr. Treadwell told\n",

      "\"No; I don't imagine you will. But at the same time, Tread, I tell you I\n",

      "strongly and as much like a bulldog as Darry does.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "clothing above the waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rub me down along the arms a bit,\" said Midshipman Treadwell, after he\n",
      "had exercised his arms a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon we'd better,\" nodded Conners. \"You must have got stiff from\n",

      "\n",
      "Dave Darrin quickly proved to be so full of vigor that Treadwell lay\n",

      "him right up with vim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, for the first forty seconds of the round no real damage was done on\n",

      "Treadwell a chance to recover his steadiness and to save himself from\n",
      "any sudden rush and clinch by his big opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Treadwell, standing with his guard up, showed no inclination to\n",
      "follow the one who had just given him such punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mix it up, gentlemen--mix it!\" called Midshipman Edgerton impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that command from the referee Dave Darrin sprang forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treadwell seemed wholly on the defensive now, though he struck as\n",
      "heavily as ever. Toward the end of the round Treadwell, having gotten\n",
      "over the worst of the stinging from his eye, once more tried to rush\n",
      "matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the big fellow's undamaged eye caught sight of the cool,\n",

      "\"Time!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "sidestep to his own right, out of range of Treadwell, to save himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at it they went, all around the ring. Darrin had determined to\n",

      "his own clear opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four or five times Treadwell landed heavily on Darrin's ribs. The\n",
      "younger, smaller midshipman was getting seriously winded, but all the\n",
      "time he fought to save himself and to get that one opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pound!\n",
      "\n",

      "under Treadwell's ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down in a heap sank the top classman. He was unconscious before his body\n",

      "\"--ten!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Mr. Treadwell lay motionless.\n",
      "\n",

      "the first classman's seconds. \"Mr. Darrin wins the second fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave, a satisfied look on his face, stepped back to his seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time he did not require as much attention. Within five minutes he\n",
      "was dressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Mr. Treadwell, under the ministrations of his seconds and\n",
      "of the late officials, was just coming back to consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something happened, eh?\" asked the top classman drowsily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather!\" murmured Mr. Edgerton dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I--did I--lose the fight?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did,\" Edgerton assented. \"But don't let that disturb you. You went\n",
      "down before the best man in the Naval Academy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Treadwell sighed gloomily. It was a hard blow to his pride--much harder\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Treadwell,\" inquired Dave, stepping over, \"we are comrades, even if\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Help me to my feet,\" urged the first classman, who was sitting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "His seconds complied. Then Midshipman Treadwell held out his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's my hand,\" he said rather thickly. \"And I apologize, too, Mr.\n",
      "Darrin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then say no more about it, please,\" begged Dave, as their hands met in\n",
      "a strong clasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the others present had the least idea of the provocation of\n",
      "this strange, spirited double fight. All, however, were glad to see the\n",
      "difficulty mended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dave and his seconds, leaving the field first, made their way back\n",
      "to Bancroft Hall. Farley and Page went straight to their own room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did it come out?\" demanded Dan Dalzell eagerly, as soon as his chum\n",
      "entered their quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping into a chair, Dave told the story of the double fight briefly.\n",
      "He told it modestly, too, but Dan could imagine what his chum omitted.\n",

      "\"David, little giant,\" exclaimed Dalzell, leaping about him, \"that fight\n",
      "will become historic here! Oh, how I regret having missed it. Don't you\n",
      "ever dare to leave me out again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't such a much,\" smiled Dave rather wearily, as he went over to\n",
      "his study desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it's indiscreet, even of a chum,\" rambled on Dalzell, \"but\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What was the fight all about?\" laughed Dave softly. \"Yes; I suppose you\n",
      "have a right to know that, Danny boy. But you must never repeat it to\n",
      "any one. Treadwell wanted to dance with Belle at the hop, but she had\n",
      "already noticed him, and declared she didn't want to dance with him. Of\n",
      "course that settled it. But Treadwell accused me of not having asked\n",
      "Belle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The nerve !\" ejaculated Dan in disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then he accused me of lying when I declared I had done my best for\n",

      "hotly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He looked solemn--unusually so, even for Lieutenant Willow, U.S.N. He\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Stearns, he of the round, jovial face, gazed at his junior with\n",
      "twinkling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willow,\" he muttered, \"I'm half inclined to believe that you've come\n",

      "\"Against two, at least,\" sighed Mr. Willow, \"and there were others\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It must be something fearful,\" said Mr. Stearns, who knew the junior\n",
      "officer's inclination to be duty-mad. \"But, see here, if you make an\n",
      "official report you'll force me to take action, even though it's\n",
      "something that I'd secretly slap a midshipman on the shoulder for doing.\n",
      "No--don't begin to talk yet, Willow. Try a cigar and then tell me,\n",
      "personally, what's worrying you. Then perhaps it won't be altogether\n",
      "needful to make an official report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never was able to take you--er--somewhat jovial views of an officer's\n",
      "duty, Stearns,\" sighed Lieutenant Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he selected a cigar, bit off the end, lighted it and took\n",
      "a few whiffs, Lieutenant-Commander Stearns all the while regarding his\n",
      "comrade in arms with twinkling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, fire ahead, Willow,\" urged the officer in charge, \"but please\n",
      "don't make your communication an official one--not at first. Fire ahead,\n",
      "now, Willow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--er--just between ourselves,\" continued Lieutenant Willow slowly,\n",
      "\"there has been a fight to-night between two midshipmen.\"\n",

      "\"No!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A fight--a real fight--with fists?\" continued the officer in charge, in\n",
      "a tone of mock incredulity. \"No, no, no, Willow, you don't mean it--you\n",
      "can't mean it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" rejoined the junior officer rather stiffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, what is the service coming to?\" gasped Stearns ironically.\n",
      "\"Why, Willow, we never heard of such things when we were midshipmen\n",
      "here. Now, did we?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid we did--sometimes,\" admitted the junior officer. \"But duty\n",
      "is duty, you know, my dear Stearns. And this was an unusual fight, too.\n",
      "The man who was whipped insisted on another fight right then and there,\n",
      "and--he won the second fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bully!\" chuckled the officer in charge. \"Whew, but I wish I had been\n",
      "there!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stearns, you surely don't mean that?\" gasped duty-mad Mr. Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're quite right, Willow. No; I certainly don't want to be a\n",
      "spoilsport, and I'm glad I wasn't there--in my official capacity. But\n",
      "I'd like to have been divested of my rank for just an hour so that I\n",
      "could have taken in such a scene as that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm--I'm just a bit astonished at your saying it, Stearns,\" rejoined\n",
      "Lieutenant Willow. \"But then, you're always joking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I am joking,\" assented the officer in charge dryly, \"but I\n",
      "never lose sight of the fact that our Navy has been built up, at huge\n",
      "expense, as a great fighting machine. Now, Willow, it takes fighting men\n",
      "to run a fighting machine. Of course, I'm terribly shocked to know that\n",
      "two midshipmen really had the grit to fight--but who were they! Mind\n",
      "you, I'm not asking you in an official way. This question is purely\n",
      "personal--just between ourselves. Who were the men? And, especially, who\n",
      "was the fellow who lost the decision, and then had the utter effrontery\n",
      "to demand a second chance at once, only to win the second fight?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darrin was the man who lost the first fight and won the second,\"\n",
      "replied Lieutenant Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin? One of our youngsters! Yes; I think I know him. And what\n",
      "man of his class did he whip, the second time he tried!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't a man of his own class. It was Mr. Treadwell, of the first\n",
      "class,\" rejoined Lieutenant Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" almost exploded the officer in charge. \"Did you say that Mr.\n",
      "Darrin fought with Mr. Treadwell, that husky top classman, and, losing\n",
      "the decision on the count, insisted on fighting again the same evening?\n",
      "Oh, say, what a fellow misses by being cooped up in an office like\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--but the breach of regulations!\" stammered the duty-mad lieutenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, neither you nor I know anything about this\n",
      "fight--officially. The Navy, after all, is a fighting machine. Do you\n",
      "feel that the Navy can afford to lose a fighting man like that\n",
      "youngster?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Lieutenant Willow left Lieutenant-Commander Stearns' presence, not\n",
      "quite convinced he was performing his whole duty, but glad to bow to the\n",
      "decision of a ranking officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days later Dave and Dan were surprised at being halted by\n",
      "Lieutenant-Commander Stearns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Mr. Darrin,\" came the pleasant greeting. \"Good\n",
      "afternoon, Mr. Dalzell. Mrs. Stearns and I would be greatly pleased if\n",
      "you could take dinner with us. Couldn't you come next Sunday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two midshipmen were astonished and delighted at this invitation.\n",
      "While it was not uncommon for officers to invite midshipmen to their\n",
      "homes, where there were so many midshipmen, it was as a rule only the\n",
      "young men who made themselves prominent socially who captured these\n",
      "coveted invitations. Darrin and Dalzell concealed their surprise, but\n",
      "expressed their pleasure in accepting the gracious invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering Mrs. Stearns' drawing room the next Sunday Mr. Darrin and\n",
      "Mr. Dalzell were introduced to two pretty girls. Miss Flora Gentle was a\n",
      "cousin of their hostess. She had visited Annapolis before, and, being\n",
      "pretty and vivacious, at the same time kind and considerate, she had\n",
      "many friends among the midshipmen. Marian Stevens, who had accompanied\n",
      "her on this visit, was a direct contrast. Flora was blonde. Marian was\n",
      "the dark, flashing type. She was spoiled and imperious, yet she had a\n",
      "dashing, open way about her that made her a favorite among young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two girls had heard of the double fight. Marian, therefore, was\n",
      "pleased when she found that Dave was to be her dinner partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's handsome,\" thought the girl, \"and he's brave and dashing. He'll\n",
      "make his mark in the Navy. He doesn't know it yet, but he'll become\n",
      "mine, and mine alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Stevens was a calculating young person, and had already decided\n",
      "that Navy life was the life for her and that she would marry into it.\n",
      "At seventeen, she looked upon the officers as old men, even the\n",
      "youngest of them, so was giving her time and her smiles to the\n",
      "midshipmen. That the Navy pay is small did not trouble Maid Marian, as\n",
      "she liked to be called, as on her twenty-first birthday she would come\n",
      "into a considerable fortune of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She exerted herself all through the Stearns' dinner to captivate Dave\n",
      "Darrin. He, without diminution of love and loyalty to Belle Mead, was\n",
      "glad to be on friendly terms with this dashing and sprightly girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee was served in the drawing room. Several officers dropped in.\n",
      "Marian, who wished no one to come between her and Dave for a while,\n",
      "turned to her host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Stearns, do the regulations make it improper for Flora and me to\n",
      "ask Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell to take us for a stroll about the yard?\"\n",
      "she asked with a pretty air of deference. The \"yard\" includes all the\n",
      "grounds belonging to the Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do not, Miss Marian,\" was the smiling response.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With our hostess's approval we shall be charmed to grant any request\n",
      "the young ladies make,\" ventured Dave, as Marian smiled into his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marian, the wily and experienced, found herself baffled during this\n",
      "walk. Using all her cajoleries, she could bring him to a certain point\n",
      "beyond which he would not go. As a matter of fact, Dave Darrin, secure\n",
      "in his loyalty to Belle, did not perceive what Maid Marian was striving\n",
      "to lead up to, but saw in her only a lively and interesting girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you yet, Midshipman Darrin,\" she vowed to herself after they\n",
      "had parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gossip of a sweetheart in his home town which in time reached her\n",
      "ears only made the girl more determined to get her way. Looking in the\n",
      "mirror with satisfaction, she murmured:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be the added zest of making Midshipman Darrin forget the\n",
      "distant face of that home girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not on that visit did Maid Marian succeed in leading Dave beyond the\n",
      "point of simple but sincere friendship. However, Miss Stevens could be\n",
      "charming to whomsoever she wished, and before she left Annapolis she had\n",
      "secured invitations to visit the wife of more than one of the officers.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas came and went, and soon after this the semi-annual\n",
      "examinations were on in earnest. Some of the midshipmen failed and sadly\n",
      "turned their faces homeward to make a place for themselves in some other\n",
      "lane of life. Dan Dalzell, however, made good his promise, and by a\n",
      "better margin than he had dared hope. Dave came through the examination\n",
      "somewhat better than his chum. Both felt assured now that they would\n",
      "round out the year with fair credit to themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian Stevens came to Annapolis several times during the latter half of\n",
      "the year, and as it is expected that the future officer shall have\n",
      "social as well as Naval training, Dave Darrin met her often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exasperation that she could draw the young midshipman on only so far\n",
      "soon changed in Miss Stevens to anger and chagrin. Still Dave, giving\n",
      "prolonged thought to no girl except Belle Meade, saw in her only a\n",
      "lively companion. Sometimes he was her dinner partner. Always at a dance\n",
      "he danced with her more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at one such dance that she looked up as they circled the room to\n",
      "say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if you know, Mr. Darrin, how much I enjoy dancing with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not as much as I enjoy dancing with you,\" he replied smilingly. Just\n",
      "then the music stopped suddenly and an officer called in a voice that\n",
      "carried over the great floor of the gymnasium and over all the chatter:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies and gentlemen, one moment's attention, please!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant all was still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" continued the officer, \"official permission has\n",
      "been granted for taking a flashlight photograph of the scene to-night.\n",
      "Will everybody please remain where he is until after the exposure has\n",
      "been made?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave and Marian had paused directly in front of the lens of the camera.\n",
      "Maid Marian looked up and made a light, jesting remark, gazing straight\n",
      "into the midshipman's eyes. Dave, smiling, bent forward to hear what she\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then came the flash, and the photographer, his work finished for\n",
      "the time, gathered his paraphernalia together and left. The music\n",
      "recommenced and the dancing proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three weeks later that photograph was reproduced as a double-page\n",
      "illustration in one of the prominent pictorial weeklies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day the magazine was on the newsstands Dan Dalzell bought a copy.\n",
      "Entering their quarters with it in his hand he opened it at the\n",
      "illustration and handed it to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and Miss Stevens show up better than any one else, Dave,\" remarked\n",
      "Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The photograph is a good piece of work,\" was Dave's only comment. He\n",
      "did not wish to express the annoyance he felt when he noted the\n",
      "appearance of intimacy between him and Marian, whose beauty showed, even\n",
      "in this reproduction. \"I'd a bit rather Belle shouldn't see this paper,\"\n",
      "he admitted to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"David, old boy, this picture would make a good exhibit in a\n",
      "breach-of-promise suit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's an unkind remark to make about a fine girl like Miss Stevens,\"\n",
      "said Dave coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan stared, then went off, pondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle Meade, in her Gridley home, received one day a large, square, thin\n",
      "package. She saw the mark of the Annapolis express office, and hastily\n",
      "snatched up scissors to cut the string. Out came a huge photograph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A picture of an Annapolis dance! How thoughtful of Dave to send it to\n",
      "me!\" Then her eyes fell on two figures around which a ring had been\n",
      "drawn in ink. They were Dave Darrin and a pretty girl. On the margin of\n",
      "the card had been scrawled in bold letters:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your affair of the heart will bear close watching if you still\n",
      "cherish!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was signed, contemptibly and untruthfully, \"A Friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uh!\" murmured Belle in hurt pride and loyalty. Then she said resolutely\n",
      "to herself: \"I will pay no attention to this. An anonymous communication\n",
      "is always meant to hurt and to give a false impression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was the picture before her eyes of Dave and the pretty girl in\n",
      "seemingly great intimacy. So though she continued to write to the\n",
      "midshipman and tried hard to make her letters sound as usual, in spite\n",
      "of herself a coldness crept into them that Dave felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She must have seen that pictorial weekly,\" thought the boy miserably.\n",
      "But as Belle said nothing of this, he could not write of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season was well along. Dave and Dan sent Belle Meade and Laura\n",
      "Bentley invitations to one of the later spring dances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if she'll come or if she's tiring of me,\" thought Dave Darrin\n",
      "bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Belle answered, accepting the invitation for Laura and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Saturday afternoon came both midshipmen hurried to the hotel in the\n",
      "town and sent up their cards. Mrs. Meade soon appeared, saying the girls\n",
      "would be down shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they both well?\" asked Dave. His tone was as one giving a\n",
      "meaningless greeting, but in his heart he waited anxiously to hear what\n",
      "her mother should say of Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, yes. But Belle has been moping around the house a great deal,\n",
      "Dave, rather unlike her usual self,\" replied Mrs. Meade slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mrs. Meade deplored this, Dave Darrin did not. It showed him at least\n",
      "that the girl's apparent coldness was not caused by her interest in some\n",
      "other young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the girls came in and Belle greeted him cordially, to be sure,\n",
      "but with something of restraint, his heart sank again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter, Belle? Has something gone wrong?\" asked Dave when\n",
      "Dan was engaging the attention of Mrs. Meade and Laura.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing. Is all right with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave, when we're alone I have something to show you. I fear you have an\n",
      "enemy here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An enemy! Oh, no. But I shall be glad to see what you have to show me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before, at a word from Dave, Dan took Mrs. Meade and\n",
      "Laura out for a walk. It was then that Belle got the large photograph\n",
      "with the two figures ringed in ink and showed it to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what does this mean? Some one must have taken a good deal of\n",
      "trouble to secure this photograph. The picture was taken for a pictorial\n",
      "weekly. One can get a photograph from which the cut is made, but it is\n",
      "troublesome and possibly expensive!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have an enemy, then; some one bent on hurting you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know who it could be. My, how angry Miss Stevens would be if\n",
      "she knew of this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Stevens? Is that the girl?\"\n",
