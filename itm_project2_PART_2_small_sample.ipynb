      "peaked crest above rugged, handsome features--a dark lock brushed\n",
      "carelessly aside by a man who had more important things to do than fuss\n",
      "with personal grooming. But no matter how carefully he combed it and\n",

      "citizens, avoiding other pedestrians, skaters and the heavy,\n",
      "four-wheeled autoscooters. Everything was dully, uncompromisingly the\n",
      "same as in his own sector, even to the size and spacing of the huge,\n",
      "spreading trees. He had hoped, without conviction, that there might be\n",

      "feeling, though, to know you'd never date or fight again, or ... Or\n",
      "what? What else was there to do, if you hadn't the luck to be a jobman\n",
      "or a tech? You ate, and slept, and preened, and exercised, and found\n",
      "what pleasure you could, and fought mostly because it was momentarily\n",
      "stimulating, and, eventually, after a hundred and fifty years or so, you\n",
      "died.\n",
      "\n",

      "nothing to keep him alive abnormally, because ninety percent of Earth's\n",
      "population was waiting for his job anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen skirted a huge fountain throwing colored, scintillant spray high\n",
      "into the dark summer sky, stealing a glance backward over his shoulder.\n",
      "That girl was still behind him. Following him? It wouldn't be anything\n",
      "new, in his case--especially in his own sector--but maybe she just\n",
      "happened to be going his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be easy to find out. He circled the fountain twice. With her\n",
      "looks she should have been picked up before she'd left her compartment\n",

      "darling.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, the way it began to look, definitely Allen's darling. On the second\n",
      "trip around, she had backtracked to meet him face to face--her purpose\n",
      "obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to dodge, but there was no way it could be done without insult.\n",
      "Damn....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hi, brute. Nedda Marsh. Alone?\" She ran soft hands along the hard\n",
      "biceps under his short jacket sleeves. The motion threw open her\n",
      "shriekingly bright orange cloak, displaying saucy breasts, creamy\n",
      "abdomen and, beneath her brief jeweled skirt, long smooth thighs. And\n",
      "the perfume assailed his nostrils with almost physical force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hi, Nedda. Allen Kinderwood. Alone, natch.\" Natch, hell. But what could\n",
      "any male do to combat Government perfume? He smiled, his pulse suddenly\n",
      "quickening. \"Date, darling?\" She _was_ a beautiful thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her large, sparkling eyes showed pleasure. \"Take me, Al.\" She touched\n",
      "vivid red lips lightly against his. And the formula was complete.\n",
      "Private citizens Allen Kinderwood and Nedda Marsh were dated at least\n",
      "until dawn--or a better man did them part.\n",
      "\n",
      "He squeezed her arm where she'd snuggled it against his side, starting\n",
      "with her away from the fountain. \"How come the most gorgeous thing in\n",
      "Kansas City wasn't dated earlier?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up at him, and the passion in her gaze made his heart skip\n",
      "like a teener's. \"Could be I'm very particular, darling, but,\" her look\n",
      "was suddenly beseeching, \"the truth is, I'm protected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A slow, tiny fire of distaste fanned itself alive in Allen's brain. Why\n",
      "in the name of World Government did every other girl who made first play\n",
      "with him have to be protected? But there was his out. By unwritten\n",
      "social code he could declare the date off. Except that he had grown to\n",
      "increasingly hate the spiteful practice of 'protection'. It meant Nedda\n",
      "had peeved some local lothario who, along with other males in his\n",
      "clique, was going to damn well see she wasn't intimate with anyone else\n",
      "until she begged another date with the original one. If you had a\n",
      "sadistic turn of mind, it meant you could keep a delectable bit in\n",
      "freeze until her natural inclinations forced her into your arms. But\n",
      "you'd have to fight any man who tried to date her in the meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting was legal, of course, as long as the loser was surgically\n",
      "repairable, and it was considered a normal catharsis for strained\n",
      "relationships between males.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not, Allen thought glumly, that he had any stake in the future of\n",
      "frantically weary society, but he had reached the conclusion long ago\n",
      "that a man without the courage to back up his personal convictions\n",
      "wasn't worth the energy it took to down him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped and held Nedda against him protectively. \"I still want the\n",
      "date, sprite,\" he said. \"I have to leave early tomorrow, but I'll try\n",
      "to get you out of protection--okay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her lips trembled. \"Oh, yes. If you knew how it's been, these last few\n",
      "days--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook her again, but more tenderly. \"Deal. We'll try to reach your\n",
      "compartment.\" Living quarters were a sanctuary no one but a medic could\n",
      "legally enter without invitation. He removed his stainless\n",
      "identification plaque and slipped its chain about her throat. \"If you\n",
      "see any of the guys who're watching for you, tell me but don't look at\n",
      "them.\" He took her arm again and alertly began to work through the\n",
      "throng. \"Describe your protector.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jeff Neal-Hayne. He's big, Al. Bigger than you. Heavier, but you've got\n",

      "\n",
      "Allen didn't know him, but the name was revealing. Not that anything but\n",
      "your Earth society number was official, but use of a double surname\n",
      "meant your father had elected to stay with your mother for at least a\n",
      "while after you were born. Most babies, of course, were immediately\n",
      "turned over to a Government creche, but it had always seemed to Allen\n",
      "that kids raised by one or more parents had other advantages too,\n",
      "although he had never been able to figure out just what they were. Maybe\n",
      "it was only his imagination.\n",

      "At the edge of the park they chose the nearest double scooter which\n",
      "showed full battery charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen leaned against the forward rail. \"Herd it, will you, Nedda? Every\n",
      "time I think of the hundreds of hours I've spent plowing air with one of\n",
      "these gut-weighted things I want to break one. Hell, I can run faster.\n",
      "Anyway, you know where we're going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl smiled, pushed the power lever into forward range and steered\n",
      "into slow-moving traffic. \"I saw a man lift a single, once, but that's\n",
      "all he was able to do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lighted street seemed intensely bright after the dimmer reaches of\n",
      "the park. \"Ever think of running one into the river?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him in amazement. \"Fright, no. Why--you'd have to drive\n",
      "along a pedestrian path for at least a block to reach the bank!\" Nedda\n",
      "spun the steering wheel to avoid a long string of solemn teeners playing\n",
      "follow the leader on singles. \"You have funny thoughts, Al.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm laughing.\" He flexed his muscles, impatient, as usual, with another\n",
      "citizen's sluggish mentation. \"I suppose the damn music never gets on\n",
      "your nerves, either?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Music? Oh--the music.\" She listened as though for the first time to the\n",
      "muted strains which played continuously throughout the city--calming,\n",
      "soothing, lulling. \"Of course not. Why should it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They've got it synchronized,\" said Allen. \"Government's got it\n",
      "synchronized so you hear it just the same volume no matter where you are\n",
      "outside. You _have_ to listen to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darling, your boredom's showing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He squeezed her hand reassuringly. \"Don't let me spin you, lovely. I've\n",

      "stuffed into heavy clothes. You can't stand the danger and the fear--and\n",
      "somehow, inside, you must know it. I'm pretty strong, and I never met a\n",
      "man I was afraid of, but I know I couldn't stand Mars.\" He gripped the\n",
      "rail and stared out over the wide, swarming street. \"But Earth is a\n",

      "without being any use at all.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Automatically, he caressed her with a practiced hand--and grabbed the\n",

      "Christ, how long had she been protected? He felt a mounting anger\n",
      "against the social ennui which drove men's minds to such inhuman\n",

      "from the city--from any city.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Departees had always been only a tiny minority. Did that mean\n",
      "they--and he--were wrong? He brooded about it for seemingly the googolth\n",
      "time, guiding the scooter without conscious thought, turning as Nedda\n",
      "directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A trap, he'd told her. Well, he could see no reason to change that. The\n",
      "blazingly glorious sensotheaters, cafes, gymnasiums, dancing salons,\n",
      "amusement rides and hypnodream houses, crowding every main thoroughfare\n",
      "with their fantastically ornate architecture, were--when you thought\n",
      "about it--designed to trap people's minds, keep them from thinking of\n",
      "anything but a gossamer, useless pursuit of personal pleasure. And\n",
      "wasn't the design faulty when everyone was bored, when some chose\n",
      "Departure and others sank to the unnatural practice of protection to\n",
      "whet their sated appetites?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was there any apparent hope for the future. Theatre productions,\n",
      "dream tapes, even the elaborate home teleview shows were all historical.\n",

      "up behind us on a single. He's one of Jeff's--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on.\" Allen swung the scooter hard right and adroitly darted across\n",
      "traffic toward an emblazoned theatre entrance. Here, now, was a\n",
      "situation he knew how to deal with. He said rapidly, out of the side of\n",
      "his mouth, \"Jump off when I stop at the entry and kiss me like good-by.\n",
      "Register your plaque in the ID slot and head for the door--then look\n",
      "back. If I'm down, go on in and lose yourself. If he's down, come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a wrenching stop at the very edge of the crowd, swung Nedda\n",
      "through the opening between front and side rails and gave her a hard,\n",
      "sterile kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "She clung to him a moment. Without letting her eyes stray she said,\n",
      "\"Slowing down right behind you. Luck, lover.\" Then she turned and\n",
      "started to pick her way across the walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen swung the scooter in a fast, tight circle to the left. Assuming\n",
      "his opponent to be right-handed, this would help avoid a knife slash\n",
      "from the rear if the other rammed his scooter--further assuming the man\n",
      "had _not_ been tricked into thinking his presence was unnoticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hadn't. When Allen whipped his head around to look at him, there was\n",
      "barely time to brake the heavier double to avoid a shrewdly planned\n",
      "collision. Halgersen, Nedda had said. He was thick-set, with heavy brows\n",
      "and large jaw. The type Allen had learned to associate with power and\n",
      "endurance but not too much speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halgersen was holding a knife in his right hand. Allen quickly slipped\n",
      "his own blade from the sheath conveniently held at the front of his\n",
      "belt. They cut intricate patterns of feint, attack and withdraw, using\n",
      "passing vehicles as buffers. But not for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice from the crowd called, \"Fight!\" and space grew miraculously\n",
      "about the combatants, leaving a huge clearing in the street rimmed\n",
      "solidly with scooters and pedestrians. A few shouts of encouragement\n",
      "began to be heard as individuals selected one or the other of the men as\n",
      "a likely winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen dodged a sudden attempt at a side-swipe collision and the\n",
      "attendant vicious swipe of Halgersen's blade--and then drew first blood\n",
      "by a lightning riposte to the arm. Legal knife target was arm, leg,\n",
      "abdomen and a forehead cut without thrust--which would obscure vision\n",
      "with blood without doing organic damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bright yellow luminescence of a police copter dropped and hovered as\n",
      "Allen tried to follow up his momentary advantage. The scene, he knew,\n",
      "would now be simultaneously filmed for possible legal record and\n",
      "broadcast on all teleview news programs. Entertainment for adults,\n",
      "education for the teeners.\n",
      "\n",
      "A feminine voice in the front ranks called, \"Two stunts to one on green\n",

      "\n",
      "He had little time to think with satisfaction that no female had ever\n",
      "been forced to pay off a bet of some ingeniously embarrassing public\n",
      "behavior on his account. Halgersen was now trying to maneuver him for a\n",
      "straight ram which would bring them definitely together. He wasn't being\n",
      "weakened by the slow drip of blood from his arm and he didn't seem to be\n",
      "bothered by pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then they were close to the circle rim. Allen swung his scooter so\n",
      "the cooling downdraft from the copter--coming from above the center of\n",
      "the cleared area--was directly against his back, a method he had devised\n",
      "for knowing his position without having to take his eyes from a close\n",
      "opponent. He let his shoulders droop suddenly, as though he was tired,\n",
      "and at the murmur of disappointment from many onlookers he began to back\n",
      "slowly away from Halgersen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blue-jacketed figure rolled into the trap scowling. He tried again\n",
      "for a head-on ram. Allen let him come, and at the last possible instant,\n",
      "when Halgersen would be unable to reverse, stop, or even swerve, he\n",
      "flipped the bar to full power ahead. And braced himself accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scooters met with a bone-jarring thud of perimeter rubber. Halgersen\n",
      "was hurled neatly over his own guard rail to land gaspingly across\n",
      "Allen's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen grasped the back of the other's belt in a grip that had dismayed\n",
      "many a combatant, hauled him into position and hamstrung both legs with\n",
      "two dextrous thrust-and-cut movements. It took but a moment longer to\n",
      "leap above a desperate slash at his own legs, drag the heavier man to\n",
      "the thick floor of the scooter and render him unconscious with a\n",
      "stamping kick of one sandaled heel. It left an easy repair job for the\n",
      "medics, but would keep one Dan Halgersen from fighting again for more\n",
      "than a week--and maybe make him think twice about joining in another\n",
      "protection pact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen leaped up and balanced on two guard rails while the police copter\n",
      "settled down to pick up Halgersen. He signaled Nedda to move on along\n",
      "the walkway.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the onlookers were clapping approval of the show, he removed\n",
      "Halgersen's plaque, leaped down and dodged an attempted kiss from the\n",
      "girl who had given odds on him--glancing back warily in case her escort\n",
      "felt insulted--then pushed through the mob to join Nedda.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hugged his arm ecstatically. \"Darling, every woman should have a guy\n",
      "like you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah.\" He felt no sense of triumph. It had happened too many times\n",
      "before. Everything had happened too many times before--repetitive,\n",
      "palling and purposeless. He tucked the won plaque into her decorative\n",
      "belt. It was Nedda's proof that protection was ended, and Halgersen\n",
      "would have to call for it accompanied by a witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where the hell is your place?\" he asked. For a moment he wondered why\n",
      "he didn't just turn abruptly and leave her, social mores\n",
      "notwithstanding. Then Nedda's perfume began its chemical magic again,\n",
      "and he carefully straightened his jacket and set his forelock in its\n",
      "proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",

      "psychoconditioning?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Allen patted her as carefully as possible to show approval without\n",
      "arousing her again. \"No man would. But it must be rough between dates,\n",
      "isn't it?\" And just why should he be worrying about anyone else at this\n",
      "stage of the game? Maybe he wasn't. Maybe he was just curious now that\n",
      "it no longer mattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She avoided his eyes in the cool semigloom of the compartment.\n",
      "\"I--usually manage to have enough dates. Until some moron like\n",

      "\n",
      "He disengaged himself gently, rolled off the pliant couch and increased\n",
      "the room's light with the wall knob. \"You should register a complaint,\n",
      "Nedda. After three he'll be forcibly psyched, you know.\" He dialed the\n",
      "servoconsole and focused a morning meal menu on the viewscreen. \"Ready\n",
      "for breakfast, pip?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mmm--if you are.\" Nedda came over and lifted the phone from its panel\n",
      "recess. \"That number six algal protein is supposed to be a new taste\n",

      "\n",
      "Allen lifted a thin transparent food cover while he shook his head.\n",
      "\"Maybe they could, Nedda. But it would have to be almost total erasure\n",
      "to change my slant on everything, and being forced to accept what I hate\n",
      "is worse than anything else I can think of. It wouldn't be me when they\n",
      "got through. Whatever causes me to think like I do is the _me_, and\n",
      "that'd be gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the resentful animosity surged up in him and he had to talk\n",
      "about it. \"Look at your compartment. The same as every other single in\n",
      "the city--or any city. The walls are the shade of green that's best for\n",
      "the eyes. Furniture and fixtures are always the same colors. Every\n",
      "compartment has a servoconsole to condition the air, control the\n",
      "temperature and humidity, bring you food or any other standard service,\n",
      "provide teleview shows, music or requests. You could live your life\n",
      "inside this square hole. Everybody has everything and nothing means\n",
      "anything--can't you see that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She came around the table and sat on his lap with her head against his\n",
      "neck. \"No, presh, but if you'll change your mind about a DP you can date\n",
      "me any time, always. I'd like to share a double with you forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He traced soothing circles on her smooth back with his fingertips.\n",
      "\"That's the closest I've ever come to _owning_ anything,\" he mused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, hon, Government owns everything and takes care of everything. When\n",
      "you can always use a thing, how could it be better if you owned it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen held her against him tightly, fighting the old fight to find\n",
      "words. How could you explain how you _felt_ things to be right or wrong,\n",
      "without really knowing the reasons?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe,\" he said slowly, \"it's as though I wanted to keep you for myself\n",
      "alone. But Nedda, if another man made the right approach, could you\n",
      "refuse him?\" After a minute he repeated, \"Could you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, she made two answers.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Adjustment Building was a soaring, chastely white structure of\n",
      "silicoid plastic, dazzling in the hot morning sun. It crossed Allen's\n",
      "mind fleetingly that everything built nowadays would long outlast the\n",
      "builders. That seemed right, but he didn't know why.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his ID plaque from Nedda and kissed her. He had tried to\n",
      "dissuade her from coming with him, but she had merely smiled and held\n",
      "his arm and urged him toward a double scooter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is it, beautiful,\" he said shortly, at the entrance. And, with an\n",
      "attempt at levity, \"Don't take any more protection.\" Actually, what\n",
      "could you say? He went inside quickly, without looking back.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door marked _Kansas City Department of Social Adjustment_, he\n",
      "slipped his plaque into the correct slot for a moment and was admitted\n",

      "\n",
      "There was only one other waiting--a handsome blond youth whose knife was\n",
      "new. Allen sat down in a lounge chair across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Nedda came in and sat down beside him.\n",
      "\n",

      "fear--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think,\" she said mischievously, taking his hand, \"the B Sector\n",
      "champ is the only one who can get an appointment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before it could more than flash through Allen's mind that he'd not told\n",
      "her that, the blond youth was standing before them, his eyes hotly on\n",
      "Nedda. Then, obviously confused that she was already holding hands, he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Marty Bowen, sir. Uh--I'm going to see if they'll let me have a double\n",

      "darting glances at Nedda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen noted, with rising anger and some other unpleasant emotion he\n",
      "couldn't define, that she hadn't dropped her eyes. He said curtly.\n",
      "\"Fine, kid--hope you make it.\" The youth mumbled something else and went\n",
      "back to his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had barely seated himself when a voder speaker crooned a number\n",
      "melodiously. With a quick backward glance at Nedda, the blond lad went\n",
      "on into the counsel room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen's mind remained in confusion, shot through with anger at himself\n",
      "that he should waste thoughts now on anything but the coming interview.\n",
      "The room was beginning to fill quietly with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "His number was called a few minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Nedda's was called along with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well--the place to get the answer was the counsel chamber. He got up\n",
      "slowly, barely noticing that Nedda continued to hold his hand as they\n",
      "went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brilliant room was two stories high, with fluted walls and no\n",
      "windows. Obviously the size was to impress interviewees. But why should\n",
      "they have to be impressed? Wasn't the wisdom of the five tech doctors\n",
      "sufficient by itself? Wasn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat in a chair indicated by the dark-skinned one, and listened while\n",
      "the very old one in the center talked to Nedda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had dating the B Sector park champion solved her difficulty with the man\n",
      "she had reported? Fine. It was the second such report about him in a\n",
      "year--the other also coming from a girl who was highly sexed. Did Nedda\n",
      "not consider herself to have a problem which required psychoconditioning?\n",
      "No? Well, perhaps in later years, when her beauty and her mind were\n",
      "somewhat changed.... No, there would seem to be no justification for\n",
      "giving her a compartment in another sector, unless she had persuaded the\n",
      "champion or another to share a double with her. Would that be all? Much\n",
      "happiness to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly, Allen realized Nedda had left and that the frail old man was\n",
      "talking to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"... unusual to have joint interviews without a more definite emotional\n",
      "tie, but we felt you would like to know how you had rendered civic aid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So pitting him without choice against any of several men was their idea\n",
      "of civic aid. No wonder he'd met so many protected girls in the past.\n",
      "This time, they'd harnessed Nedda's restless passion to the task of\n",
      "dissuading him from a DP. Very neat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It made him feel better to know they'd failed where he was concerned,\n",
      "and his resentment abated somewhat. He said, \"Glad I could help,\"\n",
      "careful to keep his voice emotionless. Then, determined to have no\n",
      "further subtleties, \"If I can have my departure permit, I won't trouble\n",
      "you further.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe his approach wasn't right, but all they could do would be to\n",
      "refuse him. In which case there were other ways--and the hell with\n",
      "legality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hope,\" smiled the old doctor benignly, \"there may be another way.\n",
      "Perhaps, if we discuss your problem, we can find a solution which won't\n",
      "cost the city a handsome young citizen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen made it a direct attack. \"Why should the city miss any citizen? In\n",
      "fact, what good is the city itself--what good is any city?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And almost, the techs seemed startled. But a younger one said easily, \"A\n",
      "city, Mr. Kinderwood, permits a maximum of efficient service and\n",
      "pleasure, with a minimum of waste and discomfort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen leaned back and stubbornly folded his arms. \"I've had enough of\n",
      "pleasures and comforts without meaning, and I've nothing to do, and it\n",
      "doesn't look like anyone's making any progress anywhere. Even on the\n",
      "planets they're just repeating backtime stuff with modern equipment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man waved a hand at the others and looked at Allen intently. His\n",
      "voice was softly insistent. \"The one continuous thread in human history\n",
      "has been the seeking of more pleasure and greater comfort for all\n",
      "members of the race. Our technology gives us a maximum of both. No one\n",
      "labors, and the few who work prefer to do so. No one is diseased, no one\n",
      "stays in pain longer than the time necessary to reach a medic. Everyone\n",
      "can have everything he needs, without striving and without debt. And as\n",
      "technology advances, there will be even greater benefits for all. What\n",
      "more can be done to make the citizens of Earth happy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, Allen felt confused. \"I don't know,\" he said slowly.\n",
      "\"The way you put it, it sounds right. But where does it all lead? What\n",
      "reason have I got for living? What reason does the human race have for\n",
      "surviving?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sociologist looked even older. \"In all seriousness, sir, can you\n",
      "answer the questions you have just asked?\" His eyes were expectant--but\n",
      "there didn't seem to be much hope reflected in their depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen noted a tenseness around the table. Why were they asking him for\n",
      "answers they were supposed to know? Or was it another of their\n",
      "subtleties?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he said curtly, \"I don't know the answer to any of them. Has it\n",
      "got a bearing on my getting a DP?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The central figure sighed. \"None at all.\" He pressed several tiny\n",
      "buttons on the polished table and an inscribed card rose halfway out of\n",
      "a slot. \"We merely hope that some day a man will come along who can tell\n",
      "us--before someone who may not be a man comes along and makes the\n",
      "answers futile.\" He handed Allen the card. \"Here is your permit. You may\n",
      "take it to the third office south on the corridor through that door. We\n",
      "don't feel it is the answer to your problem, but we admit we don't--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me, sir,\" interrupted Allen. He wet his lips. \"Did you say\n",
      "'someone who may _not be a man_'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. It is an aspect you have not considered, Mr. Kinderwood.\" The\n",
      "sociologist's face seemed haggard. \"Even a few generations ago, Earth as\n",
      "it is today would have seemed like a concept of heaven. We know now it\n",
      "is not enough, but we don't know why. Perhaps, if we can reach the stars\n",
      "the problem will cease to be critical. By the same token, life from the\n",
      "stars may come here first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no remotest idea what such an eventuality would entail. It may\n",
      "provide a solution. It may quite conceivably send man back to the\n",
      "forests and jungles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have experienced our only answer to the latter possibility. While\n",
      "providing man with everything to which he has aspired for milleniums, we\n",
      "instill in him, through the media of entertainment, knowledge of all the\n",
      "survival practices known to the backtimers who painfully nurtured\n",
      "civilization from an embryonic idea to its present pinnacle. We can do\n",
      "no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen flexed his arms involuntarily at the sheer enormity of the idea.\n",
      "It was one thing to let a useless race expire, quite another to think of\n",
      "its being forced back to-- \"But--can't anyone think of anything else to\n",
      "do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever is capable of devising anything else,\" the old doctor said\n",
      "resignedly, \"will undoubtedly be able to carry it out with or without\n",

      "the voder calling a number. \"The exit over there, Mr. Kinderwood.\n",
      "And--much happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Allen's thoughts swirled in tumultuous confusion. Dimly, he realized\n",
      "that man had outstripped himself, and saw with intense bitterness that\n",
      "there was no answer on Earth for any ordinary citizen. Or was there? And\n",
      "if there was, was it worth trying to find? He flung open the door to the\n",
      "corridor violently, as though the force could quiet his mind. Maybe, if\n",
      "he didn't use the permit, he could stay and figure out an answer. Nedda\n",
      "would be sympathetic and patient while-- And then he stopped. Across the\n",
      "wide hallway, Nedda stood beneath a window, looking at him. And the\n",
      "blond youth held her with flushed understanding, impatiently waiting,\n",

      "THE world has accepted Jesus Christ as a good man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidences of his goodness are manifold.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was full of compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never looked upon the people as a crowd. He never thought of them\n",
      "as a mass. He saw them always as individuals. His heart went out to\n",
      "them. All his impulses were to pity them, sympathize with, and help\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went among them. He entered into all conditions, accepted all\n",
      "situations. He was present at a wedding, he ate with publicans and\n",
      "sinners and, anon, was guest at a rich man's table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw the ravages of disease, the shame of sin, the tragedies in\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew there was torture in body and anguish in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the mystery of pain and laid it upon his heart, until tears\n",
      "were his meat and his drink, by day and by night. He became a man of\n",
      "sorrows and an expert in grief. He took upon him the woes of the\n",
      "world till he was bowed and bent, as with the weight of years. The\n",
      "tears of sympathy grooved his cheeks, as when streams carve their\n",
      "way down mountain sides. Because of this men looked at him and saw\n",
      "neither form nor comeliness; neither was there any beauty in him\n",
      "that they should desire him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a beneficent man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multitudes of men are benevolent, but not beneficent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benevolence is well wishing. Beneficence is well doing. He was\n",
      "always well doing, giving sight to the blind, healing the sick,\n",
      "cleansing the leper, feeding the hungry, raising the dead, unloosing\n",
      "the bonds of Satan--unwinding the serpent's coil.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was absolutely unselfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "He emptied himself and made room in his soul for other lives. He had\n",
      "no office hours and never interposed secretaries or major-domos\n",
      "between himself and the people. He received all who came unto him--\n",
      "ministering without money and without price.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one scene that might well be painted by a master hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evening. The western sky is all aglow with the glory of the\n",
      "setting sun. Far up in the dome of the infinite blue, the evening\n",
      "star swings golden, like a slow descending lamp let down by\n",
      "invisible hands. The street is in half-tone. It is packed by the\n",
      "strangest of throngs, by the blind, the lame, the halt, the\n",
      "paralyzed and the leper-derelicts of humanity--borne thither on a\n",
      "surging tide of life in which every wave is an accent of pain; they\n",
      "are driven and piled up in great, quivering heaps against a door\n",
      "which is partly shut, as in self-defence, by the sweltering crowd\n",
      "within.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus of Nazareth is in that house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is healing the sick. He is giving health, and strength, and peace\n",
      "to all who seek him. He turns no one away. Compassion, sympathy,\n",
      "beneficence, the tenderness of a mother for her helpless babe--these\n",
      "are the characteristics which his daily ministry revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one ever brought a charge of evil doing or evil speaking against\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people who followed him said, \"He hath done all things well.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "him in the midst of the people, speaking words that hushed their\n",

      "officers returning to them who sent them, said, \"Never man spake\n",
      "like this man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pilate's wife dreamed a troubled dream of him, and sent word to her\n",
      "husband not to lay hands on him--seeing that he was a just man.\n",
      "Thrice before heaven and earth--in a testimony that still echoes\n",
      "through infinite spaces, and is heard by listening worlds--Pilate\n",
      "himself proclaimed, \"I find no fault in this man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted up his voice against sin and unrighteousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against nothing did he so much speak as against religious hypocrisy.\n",
      "Nowhere, in any record, is language so terrible, so penetrating, so\n",
      "hot, so full of the flame of fire and scorching analysis, scorching\n",
      "and burning in its denunciation of those who on the outside (in\n",
      "their religious profession) were like whitened sepulchres, but on\n",
      "the inside (in their actual lives) were full of dead men's bones and\n",
      "corruption--nowhere, outside the twenty-third chapter of Matthew,\n",
      "does language fall with such tremendous vibration of thunderous\n",
      "indignation, and the accent of aroused and fully angered justice.\n",
      "\"Ye serpents,\" \"ye generation of vipers,\" are some of the phrases;\n",
      "and the words, \"fools,\" \"blind hypocrites,\" mingle again and again\n",
      "with the far-sounding, judicial menace, \"Woe, woe unto you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to be dominated and controlled by one idea--the idea of\n",
      "God. The God thought held and moved him. He could not go anywhere,\n",
      "or see anything, or utter the shortest discourse, that he did not,\n",
      "in some fashion, connect it with the infinite Father. Was a sower\n",
      "sowing seed, he saw in that incident an illustration of the fact\n",
      "that the true seed is the Word of God, and the true sower he who\n",
      "casts it into the mightier ground of the human heart. Did a flock of\n",
      "sheep lie at rest upon the hillside, guarded by a shepherd's care,\n",
      "at once he would unfold the shepherding of a Father's love. A tiny\n",
      "sparrow, flying an unnoticed speck in the distant sky, or falling\n",
      "ground-ward with its weary flight, was a winged witness that the\n",
      "Father knew and saw even the smallest details of human life. A lily\n",
      "in its lowliness, and yet a lily in its beauty shaming a king's\n",
      "array, a lily, toiling not, but upward growing, furnished him a text\n",
      "from which to preach the providence of God; and a wandering beggar\n",
      "boy far away from home and kindred, stained with sin and dark with\n",
      "sorrow, gave occasion for the wondrous story of the Prodigal Son and\n",
      "a father's changeless and tender love.\n",
      "\n",
      "God! God! God! this was the supreme note of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the cross he gave utterance to words which reveal the inner\n",
      "character of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a man has been lied about, falsified, his good evil spoken of\n",
      "and his reputation assailed (as was his before the Sanhedrin--in the\n",
      "mock trial given him there), when such a man has been hounded from\n",
      "one end of the town to the other, spit upon and jibed at and,\n",
      "finally, nailed through hands and feet to a torturing cross; when\n",
      "such a man with his heart bursting (because of the impeded\n",
      "circulation, driving the surging, tumultuous blood back upon it),\n",
      "with the sun scorching his bare temples, a crown of thorns stabbing\n",
      "him at every helpless turn of his restless head; when such a man,\n",
      "under such circumstances, can rise above the wickedness, cowardice\n",
      "and cheap treason that have nailed him to the cross, and pray (and\n",
      "pray sincerely) that his guilty murderers, villainous detractors and\n",
      "unscrupulous slanderers may be forgiven, that man bears witness that\n",
      "he has, at least, a heart of good.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was just such a prayer which came from the parched, dry,\n",
      "cracked lips of this man of Nazareth as he hung upon the cross and\n",
      "cried out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he spoke from the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was standing near, a woman who had been chosen of God to give\n",
      "him birth. She was sobbing convulsively. She was realizing what had\n",
      "been foretold of her more than thirty years before--\"a sword shall\n",
      "pierce through thy own soul, also.\" Mary, the mother of Jesus, stood\n",
      "there, brokenhearted. Jesus turned his head and looked at John, his\n",
      "cousin, bidding him take that weeping mother to his home, his heart\n",
      "and care, and be unto her henceforth a loving son.\n",
      "\n",
      "O the man who, in the hour of his own agony, shall remember his\n",
      "mother, and crown her, make her the queen of his life, and ordain\n",
      "that others shall love and reverence her, proclaims for himself the\n",
      "lustre of a manhood without spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more he spoke from the place of anguish--that moment on the\n",
      "edge of death. There his soul, rising from the depths of the\n",
      "overwhelming waves of agony, cries:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He who in the hour and article of death can face God and eternity,\n",
      "and commit himself to the hand of supreme justice as a confident\n",
      "child to the arms of a loving father, bears witness that in his soul\n",
      "there is no ghastly memory of sin, no sharp, remembered pang, no\n",
      "fear of offended law. Such a confidence and such a committal of\n",
      "triumphant calm bear witness that the heart is at rest with God, and\n",
      "is conscious of its own good.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two thousand years the world, without a dissenting voice, has\n",
      "borne witness that he is the one man who came into the earth and\n",
      "walked through it superlatively good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the voices in the common consent of the world that Jesus\n",
      "Christ was a good man, there are those who with equal insistence\n",
      "deny that he was Almighty God.\n",

      "Absolutely it is not!\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole being of man revolts against it, morally, intellectually\n",
      "and organically. Every law of nature in man is against it. Pain and\n",

      "\n",
      "The process which renews the body every seven years--so far as any\n",
      "law in nature shows--might go on indefinitely; there is no reason in\n",

      "for cause; being such, it is a judicial act, a judgment, and\n",
      "becomes, necessarily, a penalty. Penalty stands for violated law.\n",
      "Violated law is transgression. Transgression is sin. Sin, in final\n",

      "\n",
      "In thus determining and defining death, Christianity reveals both\n",
      "its essence and its mission; for, through its Gospel, Christianity\n",
      "brings the good news that the issue of sin and death as between God\n",
      "and man has been settled by our Lord Jesus Christ; that he has\n",
      "settled it perfectly and forever according to the terms of divine\n",
      "righteousness by dying as a sacrifice for sin and as a substitute\n",
      "for sinners.\n",

      "In order to be a substitute it was necessary that our Lord Jesus\n",
      "Christ should be a sinless man; otherwise, his death would be only\n",

      "and fit for judgment--the end of all flesh is come before me--and\n",
      "that end is death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanity of Christ is, therefore, not an evolution, but a new\n",

      "condemnation of him. It does not say to him, \"Follow me, imitate me\n",
      "and you will be like me\"; it says: \"I am from above, ye are from\n",

      "what he was in himself; it does not depend upon the length of time\n",
