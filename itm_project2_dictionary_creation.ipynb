      "\"I'm afraid it must have gone on in the van, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gone on!\" Hugh Gifford exclaimed angrily. \"But you had no business to\n",
      "send the train on till all the luggage was put out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The guard told me that all the luggage for Branchester was out,\" the\n",
      "porter protested deprecatingly. \"You see, sir, the train was nearly\n",
      "twenty minutes late, and in his hurry to get off he must have overlooked\n",
      "your suit-case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The very thing I wanted most,\" the owner returned. \"I say, Kelson,\" he\n",
      "went on, addressing a tall, soldierly man who strolled up, \"a nice thing\n",
      "has happened; the train has gone off with my evening clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson whistled. \"Are you sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite.\" Gifford appealed to the porter, who regretfully confirmed the\n",
      "statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's awkward to-night,\" Kelson commented with a short laugh of\n",
      "annoyance. \"Look here, we'd better interview the station-master, and have\n",
      "your case wired for to the next stop. I am sorry, old fellow, I kept you\n",
      "talking instead of letting you look after your rattle-traps, but I was so\n",
      "glad to see you again after all this long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks, my dear Harry, you've nothing to blame yourself about. It was my\n",
      "own fault being so casual. The nuisance is that if I don't get the\n",
      "suit-case back in time I shan't be able to go with you to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" his friend responded; \"that would be a blow. And it's going to\n",
      "be a ripping dance. Dick Morriston, who hunts the hounds, is doing the\n",
      "thing top-hole. Now let's see what the worthy and obliging Prior can\n",
      "do for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The station-master was prepared to do everything in his power, but\n",
      "that did not extend to altering the times of the trains or shortening\n",
      "the mileage they had to travel. He wired for the suit-case to be put\n",
      "out at Medford, the next stop, some forty miles on, and sent back by\n",
      "the next up-train. \"But that,\" he explained, \"is a slow one and is\n",
      "not due here till 9.47. However, I'll send it on directly it arrives,\n",
      "and you should get it by ten o'clock or a few minutes after. You are\n",
      "staying at the _Lion_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not more than ten or twelve minutes' drive. I'll do my best and there\n",
      "shall be no delay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men thanked him and walked out to the station yard, where a\n",
      "porter waited with the rest of Gifford's luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a gentleman here going to the _Lion_\" he said with a rather\n",
      "embarrassed air; \"I told him your fly was engaged, sir; but he said\n",
      "perhaps you would let him share it with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson looked black. \"I like the way some people have of taking things\n",
      "for granted. Cheek, I call it. He had better wait or walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The gentleman said he was in a hurry, sir,\" the porter observed\n",
      "apologetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No reason why he should squash us up in the fly,\" Kelson returned. \"I'll\n",
      "have a word with the gentleman. Where is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he is in the fly, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The devil he is! We'll have him out, Hugh. Infernally cool.\" And he\n",
      "strode off towards the waiting fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better see what sort of chap he is before you go for him, Harry,\"\n",
      "Gifford said deprecatingly as he followed. He knew his masterful friend's\n",
      "quick temper, and anticipated a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you don't mind, this is my fly, sir,\" Kelson was saying as Gifford\n",
      "reached him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The porter told me it was the _Golden Lion_ conveyance,\" a strong,\n",
      "deeply modulated voice replied from the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I think he told you it was engaged,\" Kelson rejoined bluffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not quite understand that,\" the voice of the occupant replied in\n",
      "an even tone. \"I am sorry if there has been any misunderstanding; but as\n",
      "I am going to the hotel--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is no reason why you should take our fly,\" Kelson retorted, his\n",
      "temper rising at the other's coolness. \"I must ask you to vacate it at\n",
      "once,\" he added with heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many of you are there?\" The man leaned forward showing in the\n",
      "doorway a handsome face, dark almost to swarthiness. \"Only two? Surely\n",
      "there is no need to turn me out. You don't want to play the dog in the\n",
      "manger. There is room for all three, and I shall be happy to contribute\n",
      "my share of the fare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want anything of the sort--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson was beginning angrily when Gifford intervened pacifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all right, Harry. We can squeeze in. The fellow seems more or less\n",
      "a gentleman; don't let's be churlish,\" he added in an undertone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is infernal impudence,\" Kelson protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but we don't want a row. It is not as though there was another\n",
      "conveyance he could take.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. I suppose we shall have to put up with the brute,\" Kelson\n",
      "assented grudgingly. \"But I hate being bounced like this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford took a step to the carriage-door. \"I think we can all three pack\n",
      "in,\" he said civilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take the front seat, if you like,\" the stranger said, without,\n",
      "however, showing much inclination to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; stay where you are,\" Gifford answered. \"I fancy I am the\n",
      "smallest of the three; I shall be quite comfortable there. Come\n",
      "along, Harry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With no very amiable face Kelson got in and took the vacant seat by the\n",
      "stranger. His attitude was not conducive to geniality, and so for a while\n",
      "there was silence. At length as they turned from the station approach on\n",
      "to the main road the stranger spoke. His deep-toned voice had a musical\n",
      "ring in it, yet somehow to Gifford's way of thinking it was detestable.\n",
      "Perhaps it was the speaker's rather aggressive and, to a man,\n",
      "objectionable personality, which made it seem so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to inconvenience you,\" he said, more with an air of saying\n",
      "the right thing than from any real touch of regret. \"On an occasion like\n",
      "this they ought to provide more conveyances. But country towns are\n",
      "hopeless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it is all right,\" Gifford responded politely. \"The drive is not\n",
      "very long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mile?\" The man's musical inflection jarred on Gifford, who began to\n",
      "wonder whether their companion could be a professional singer. One of\n",
      "their own class he certainly was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I presume you gentlemen are going to the Hunt Ball?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a new departure having it in a private house,\" the man said.\n",
      "\"Quite a sound idea, I have no doubt Morriston will do us as well--much\n",
      "better than we should fare at the local hotel or Assembly Rooms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going?\" They were the first words Kelson had uttered since the\n",
      "start, and the slight surprise in their tone was not quite complimentary.\n",
      "It must have so struck the other, seeing that he replied with a touch of\n",
      "resentment:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No reason at all,\" Kelson answered, except that I don't remember to have\n",
      "seen you out with the Cumberbatch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say not,\" the other rejoined easily. \"It is some years since I\n",
      "hunted with them. I'm living down in the south now, and when I'm at home\n",
      "usually turn out with the Bavistock. Quite a decent little pack, _faute\n",
      "de mieux_; and Bobby Amphlett, who hunts them, is a great pal of mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see,\" Kelson observed guardedly. \"Yes, I believe they are quite good\n",
      "as far as they go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger gave a short laugh. \"They, or rather a topping old dog-fox,\n",
      "took us an eleven mile point the other day, which was good enough in that\n",
      "country. Being in town I thought I would run down to this dance for old\n",
      "acquaintance' sake. Dare say one will meet some old friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt,\" Kelson responded dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you have been good enough to ask me to share your fly,\" the man\n",
      "observed, with a rather aggressive touch of irony, \"I may as well let you\n",
      "know who I am. My name is Henshaw, Clement Henshaw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any relation to Gervase Henshaw?\" Gifford asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is my brother. You know him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only by reputation at my profession, the Bar. And I came across a book\n",
      "of his the other day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes. Gervase scribbles when he has time. He is by way of being an\n",
      "authority on criminology.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is, I should say,\" Gifford added civilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he is a smart fellow. Has the brains of the family. I'm all for\n",
      "sport and the open-air life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" thought Gifford, glancing at the dark, rather intriguing face\n",
      "opposite to him, \"you don't look a sportsman. More a _viveur_ than a\n",
      "regular open-air man, more at home in London or Paris than in the\n",
      "stubbles or covert.\" But he merely nodded acceptance of Henshaw's\n",
      "statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Kelson,\" the soldier said, supplying an omission due to\n",
      "Henshaw's talk of himself. \"I have hunted this country pretty regularly\n",
      "since I left the Service. And my friend is Hugh Gifford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gifford? Did not Wynford Place where we are going to-night belong to the\n",
      "Giffords?\" Henshaw asked, curiosity overcoming tact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford answered, \"to an uncle of mine. He sold it lately to\n",
      "Morriston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah; a pity. Fine old place,\" Henshaw observed casually. \"Naturally you\n",
      "know it well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have had very good times there,\" Gifford answered, with a certain\n",
      "reserve as though disinclined to discuss the subject with a stranger. \"I\n",
      "have come down now also for old acquaintance' sake,\" he added casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see,\" Henshaw responded. \"Not altogether pleasant, though, to see an\n",
      "old family place in the hands of strangers. Personally, when a thing is\n",
      "irrevocably gone, as, I take it, Wynford Place is, I believe in letting\n",
      "it slide out of one's mind, and having no sentiment about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt a very convenient plan,\" Gifford replied dryly. \"All the same,\n",
      "if I can retrieve my evening kit, which has gone astray, I hope to enjoy\n",
      "myself at Wynford Place to-night without being troubled with undue\n",
      "sentimentality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" Henshaw responded with what seemed a half-smothered yawn. \"Regret\n",
      "for a thing that is gone past recall does not pay; though as long as\n",
      "there is a chance of getting it I believe in never calling oneself\n",
      "beaten. Here we are at the _Lion_.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What do you think of our acquaintance?\" Gifford said as they settled\n",
      "down in the private room of Kelson, who made the _Golden Lion_ his\n",
      "hunting quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much. In fact, I took a particular dislike to the fellow. Wrong type\n",
      "of sportsman, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Decidedly. Fine figure of a man and good-looking enough, but spoilt by\n",
      "that objectionable, cock-sure manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I should say a by no means decent character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A swanker to the finger-tips. And that implies a liar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not worth discussing,\" Kelson said. \"He goes to-morrow. I made a point\n",
      "of inquiring how long he had engaged his room for. One night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good. Then we shan't be under the ungracious necessity of shaking him\n",
      "off. I can't tell you how sick I am, Harry, at the loss of my things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more than I am, my dear fellow. If only a suit of mine would fit you.\n",
      "But that's hopeless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They both laughed ruefully at the idea, for Captain Kelson looked nearly\n",
      "twice the size of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll hope they'll arrive in time for you to see something of the fun at\n",
      "any rate,\" Kelson said. \"I'm in no hurry; I'll wait with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will do nothing of the sort, Harry,\" Gifford protested. \"Do you\n",
      "think I can't amuse myself for an hour or two alone? You'll go off at the\n",
      "proper time. Absurd to wait till every decent girl's card is full.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like it, Hugh.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor do I. But it is practically my fault in not looking sharper after my\n",
      "luggage, and better one should suffer than two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was arranged that Captain Kelson should go on alone and his\n",
      "guest should follow as soon as his clothes turned up and he could\n",
      "change into them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That settled, they sat down to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me about the Morristons, Harry,\" Gifford said. \"He is a very good\n",
      "fellow, isn't he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick Morriston? One of the best. Straight goer to hounds and straight in\n",
      "every other capacity, I should say. You know they used to live at Friar's\n",
      "Norton, near here, before they bought your uncle's place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know. What is the sister like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fine, handsome girl,\" Kelson answered, without enthusiasm. \"Rather too\n",
      "cold and statuesque for my taste, although I have heard she has a bit of\n",
      "the devil in her. Quite a sportswoman, and as good after hounds as her\n",
      "brother. They say she had a thin time of it with her step-mother, and has\n",
      "come out wonderfully since the old lady died. Lord Painswick, who lives\n",
      "near here, is supposed to be very sweet on her. Perhaps the affair will\n",
      "develop to-night. The ball will be rather a toney affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Morriston has plenty of money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaps. And the sister is an heiress too. The old man did not nearly live\n",
      "up to his income and there were big accumulations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which enabled the son to buy our property,\" Gifford said with a tinge\n",
      "of bitterness. \"Well, it might have been worse. Wynford has not passed\n",
      "into the hands of some Jew millionaire or City speculator, but has gone\n",
      "to a gentleman, a good fellow and a sportsman, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Dick Morriston is all that. As the place had to go, you could not\n",
      "have found a better man to succeed your people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the time came to start for the ball Gifford went down to see his\n",
      "friend off and to repeat his orders concerning the immediate delivery of\n",
      "his suit-case when it should arrive. Henshaw was in the hall, bulking big\n",
      "in a fur coat and complaining in a masterful tone of the unpunctuality of\n",
      "his fly. A handsome fellow, Gifford was constrained to acknowledge, and\n",
      "of a strong, positive character; the type of man, he thought, who could\n",
      "be very fascinating to women--and very brutal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dropped his rather bullying manner as he caught sight of the two\n",
      "friends; and, noticing Gifford's morning clothes, made a casually\n",
      "sympathetic remark on his bad luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I shall come on when my things arrive, which ought to be soon,\"\n",
      "Gifford responded coldly, disliking the man and his rather obvious\n",
      "insincerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We might have driven over together,\" Henshaw said, addressing\n",
      "Kelson. \"But I hardly cared to propose it after the line you took at\n",
      "the station.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an unpleasant curl of the lip as he spoke the words almost\n",
      "vindictively, as though with intent to put Kelson in the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his sneer had no effect on the ex-Cavalryman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am driving over in my own trap,\" he replied coolly, ignoring the\n",
      "other's intent. \"You will be a good deal more comfortable in a closed\n",
      "carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Decidedly,\" Henshaw returned with a laugh. \"I am not so fond of an east\n",
      "wind as to get more of it than can be helped. And, after all, it is best\n",
      "to go independently to an affair of this sort. One may get bored and want\n",
      "to leave early.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson nodded with a grim appreciation of the man's trick of argument,\n",
      "and went out to his waiting dog-cart. Henshaw's fly drove up as Gifford\n",
      "turned back from the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose we shall see you towards midnight,\" he said lightly as he\n",
      "passed Gifford, his tone clearly suggesting his utter indifference in\n",
      "the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say,\" Gifford replied, and as he went upstairs he heard an\n",
      "order given for \"Mr. Henshaw's fire in number 9 to be kept up against\n",
      "his return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alone in the oak-panelled sitting-room Gifford settled down to wait for\n",
      "his clothes. He skimmed through several picture-papers that were lying\n",
      "about, and then took up a novel. But a restless fit was on him, and he\n",
      "could not settle down to read. He threw aside the book and began thinking\n",
      "of the old property which his uncle had muddled away, and recalling the\n",
      "happy times he had spent there from his schooldays onwards. Memories of\n",
      "the rambling old house and its park crowded upon him. By force of one\n",
      "circumstance or another he had not been there for nearly ten years, and a\n",
      "great impatience to see it again took hold of him. He looked at the\n",
      "clock. At the best, supposing there were no hitch, his suit-case could\n",
      "hardly arrive for another hour and a half. Wynford Place was a bare mile\n",
      "away, perhaps twenty minutes' walk; the night was fine and moonlight, he\n",
      "was getting horribly bored in that room; he would stroll out and have a\n",
      "look at the outside of the old place. After all, it was only the exterior\n",
      "that he could expect to find unaltered; doubtless the Morristons with\n",
      "their wealth had transformed the interior almost out of his knowledge.\n",
      "Anyhow he would see that later. Just then he simply longed for a sight of\n",
      "the ancient house with its detached tower and the familiar landmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly he filled a pipe, put on a thick overcoat and a golf cap and\n",
      "went out, leaving word of his return within the hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a good two hours before he reappeared, and the landlord, who\n",
      "met him with the news that the missing suit-case had been awaiting him in\n",
      "his room since twenty minutes past ten, was struck by a certain\n",
      "peculiarity in his manner. It was nothing very much beyond a suggestion\n",
      "of suppressed excitement and that rather wild look which lingers in a\n",
      "man's eyes when he is just fresh from a dispute or has experienced a\n",
      "narrow escape from danger. Then Gifford ordered a stiff glass of spirits\n",
      "and soda and drank it off before going up to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you be going to Wynford Place, sir?\" the landlord inquired as he\n",
      "glanced at the clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford hesitated a moment. \"Yes. Let me have a fly in a quarter of an\n",
      "hour,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was more than double that time when he came down dressed for\n",
      "the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old house looked picturesque enough in the moonlight as he approached\n",
      "it. All the windows in the main building were lighted up, and there was a\n",
      "pleasant suggestion of revelry about the ivy-clad pile. Standing some\n",
      "dozen yards from the house, but connected with it by a covered way, was a\n",
      "three-storied tower, the remains of a much older house, and from the\n",
      "lower windows of this lights also shone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford entered the well-remembered hall and made his way, almost in a\n",
      "dream, to the ball-room, where many hunting men in pink made the scene\n",
      "unusually gay. Unable for the moment to catch sight of Kelson, he had to\n",
      "introduce himself to his host, who had heard of his mishap and gave him a\n",
      "cheerily sympathetic welcome. Richard Morriston was a pleasant-looking\n",
      "man of about five or six-and-thirty, the last man, Gifford thought, he\n",
      "would bear a grudge against for possessing the old home of the Giffords.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid you must look upon me rather in the light of an intruder\n",
      "here,\" Morriston said pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very acceptable one so far as I am concerned,\" Gifford responded with\n",
      "something more than empty civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very kind of you to say so,\" his host rejoined. \"Anyhow the least\n",
      "I can do is to ask you with all sincerity to make yourself free of the\n",
      "place while you are in the neighbourhood. Edith,\" he called to a tall,\n",
      "handsome girl who was just passing on a man's arm, \"this is Mr. Gifford,\n",
      "who knows Wynford much better than we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston left her partner and held out her hand. \"We were so\n",
      "sorry to hear of your annoying experience,\" she said. \"These railway\n",
      "people are too stupid. I am so glad you retrieved your luggage in time\n",
      "to come on to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford was looking at her with some curiosity during her speech, and\n",
      "quickly came to the conclusion that Kelson's description of her had\n",
      "certainly not erred on the side of exaggeration. She looked divinely\n",
      "handsome in her ball-dress of a darkish shade of blue, relieved by a\n",
      "bunch of roses in her corsage and a single diamond brooch. Statuesque,\n",
      "too statuesque, Kelson had called her; certainly her manner and bearing\n",
      "had a certain cold stateliness, but Gifford had penetration enough to\n",
      "see that behind the reserve and the society tone of her welcome there\n",
      "might easily be a depth of feeling which his friend with a lesser\n",
      "knowledge of human nature never suspected. An interesting girl,\n",
      "decidedly, Gifford concluded as he made a suitable acknowledgment of her\n",
      "greeting, and, I fancy, my friend Harry takes a rather too superficial\n",
      "view of her character, he thought, as strolling off in search of\n",
      "Kelson, he found himself watching his hostess from across the room with\n",
      "more than ordinary interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "He soon encountered Kelson coming out of a gaily decorated passage which\n",
      "he knew led to the old tower. He had a pretty girl on his arm, tall and\n",
      "fair, but with none of Miss Morriston's dignified coldness. This girl had\n",
      "a sunny, laughing face, and Gifford thought he understood why his friend\n",
      "had not been enthusiastic over the probable Lady Painswick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson, receiving him with delight, introduced him, with an air of\n",
      "proprietorship it seemed, to his companion, Miss Tredworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been exploring the old tower?\" Gifford asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been sitting out there,\" Kelson answered with a laugh. \"They have\n",
      "converted the lower rooms into quite snug retreats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In my uncle's day they were anything but snug,\" Gifford observed. \"I\n",
      "remember we used to play hide-and-seek up there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke with preoccupation, his eyes fixed on a bunch of white flowers\n",
      "which the girl wore on her black dress. They were slightly blotched and\n",
      "sprinkled with a dark colour in a way which was certainly not natural,\n",
      "and Gifford, held by the peculiar sight, looked in wonder from the\n",
      "flowers to the girl's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must give Gifford a dance,\" Kelson said, breaking up the rather\n",
      "awkward pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid my card is full,\" Miss Tredworth said, holding it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed happily. \"Then he shall have one of mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gifford protested. \"Indeed I won't rob you, Harry,\" he declared. \"I'm\n",
      "tired, and should be a stupid partner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tired?\" Kelson remonstrated. \"Why, you have been resting at the _Lion_\n",
      "waiting for your things while we have been dancing our hardest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Resting? No; I went out for a walk,\" Gifford replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The deuce you did! Where did you go to?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nowhere particular,\" Gifford answered rather evasively. \"Just about\n",

      "Hugh Gifford did not stay very long at the dance. He took a mouthful of\n",
      "supper, and then told Kelson that he had a headache and was going to walk\n",
      "back to the _Golden Lion_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson was distressed. \"My dear fellow, coming so late and going so\n",
      "early, it's too bad. This is the best time of the night. I hope the old\n",
      "place with its memories hasn't distressed you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" was the answer. \"But something has upset me. I'll get back and\n",
      "turn in. By the way, I don't see that man Henshaw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Kelson replied casually; \"I haven't seen him lately. But then I've\n",
      "had something better to think about than that ineffable bounder. He was\n",
      "here all right in the early part of the evening. One couldn't see\n",
      "anything else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dancing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More or less. Well, if you will go, old fellow, do make yourself\n",
      "comfortable at the _Lion_ and call for anything you fancy. I'm dancing\n",
      "this waltz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford left the dance and went back to the hotel. He seemed perplexed\n",
      "and worried, so much so that for some time he paced his room restlessly\n",
      "and then, instead of turning in, he went back to the sitting-room,\n",
      "lighted a pipe, and settled himself there to await his friend's return.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nearly three o'clock when Kelson came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Hugh!\" he exclaimed in surprise. \"Still up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't feel like sleeping,\" Gifford answered, \"and if I'm to keep\n",
      "awake I'd rather stay up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson looked at him curiously. \"I hope the visit to your old home hasn't\n",
      "been too much for you,\" he remarked with the limited sympathy of a strong\n",
      "man whose nerves are not easily affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" Gifford assured him. \"Although somehow I did feel rather out\n",
      "of it. I have had rather a teasing day, but I shall be all right in the\n",
      "morning, and am looking forward to a run round the scenes of my\n",
      "childhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" Kelson responded, relieved to think his friend's visit was not\n",
      "after all going to be as dismal as he had begun to fear. \"Well, Hugh,\" he\n",
      "added gaily. \"I have a piece of news for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not that you are engaged?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something, an almost apprehensive touch, in Gifford's tone rather took\n",
      "his friend aback.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To Miss--the girl you were dancing with?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Gifford's tone gave a check to Kelson's enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with a more serious face that he replied, \"Muriel Tredworth, the\n",
      "best girl in England. I hope, my dear Hugh, you are not going to say you\n",
      "don't think so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not,\" Gifford answered promptly. \"I never saw or heard of her\n",
      "before to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed uncomfortably. A man in love and in the flush of\n",
      "acceptance wants something more than a lukewarm reception of the news.\n",
      "\"I'm glad to hear it,\" he responded dryly. \"From your tone one might\n",
      "almost imagine that you knew something against Muriel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven forbid!\" Gifford ejaculated fervently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't congratulate me,\" his friend returned with a touch of\n",
      "suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford forced a laugh. \"My dear Harry, you have taken my breath away.\n",
      "You deserve the best wife in the kingdom, and I sincerely hope you have\n",
      "got her,\" he said, not very convincingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "His half-heartedness, not too successfully masked, evidently struck\n",
      "Kelson. \"One would hardly suppose you thought so,\" he said in a hurt\n",
      "tone. \"I wish,\" he added warmly, \"if there is anything at the back of\n",
      "your words you would speak out. I should hope we are old friends enough\n",
      "for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford glanced at the worried face of the big, simple-minded sportsman,\n",
      "more or less a child in his knowledge of the subtleties of human nature,\n",
      "and as he did so his heart smote him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are, and I hope we always shall be,\" he declared, grasping his hand.\n",
      "\"You are making too much of my unfortunate manner to-night, and I'm\n",
      "sorry. With all my heart I congratulate you, and wish you every blessing\n",
      "and all happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an unmistakable ring of sincerity in his speech now, and,\n",
      "without going aside to question its motive, as a more penetrating\n",
      "mind might have done, Kelson accepted his friend's congratulations\n",
      "without question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thanks, old fellow,\" he responded, brightening as he returned the grasp\n",
      "of Gifford's hand. \"I was sure of your good wishes. You need not fear I\n",
      "have made a mistake. Muriel is a thorough good sort, and we shall suit\n",
      "each other down to the ground. We've every chance of happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Gifford could reply there came a knock at the door. The\n",
      "landlord entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beg your pardon, captain,\" he said, \"I'm sorry to trouble you, but could\n",
      "you tell me whether they are keeping up the Hunt Ball very late?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Dipper,\" Kelson answered. \"It was all over long ago. I was one\n",
      "of the last to come away. We left to the strains of the National Anthem.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dipper's face assumed a perplexed expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, captain,\" he said. \"My reason for asking the question is that\n",
      "Mr. Henshaw, who has a room here, has not come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not come in?\" Kelson repeated. \"Too bad to keep you up, Mr. Dipper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, captain,\" said the landlord, \"you see it is getting on for four\n",
      "o'clock, and we want to lock up. Of course if the ball was going on we\n",
      "should be prepared to keep open all night if necessary. But my drivers\n",
      "told me an hour ago it was over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it was. I wonder\"--Kelson turned to Gifford--\"what can have become of\n",
      "the egregious Henshaw. I don't think, as I told you in the ball-room, I\n",
      "have seen him since ten o'clock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shrugged. \"Unless he has come across friends and gone off\n",
      "with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He couldn't well do that without calling here for his things,\"\n",
      "Kelson objected. \"I suppose he did not do that, unknown to you?\" he\n",
      "asked the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, captain. His things are all laid out in his room, and the fire kept\n",
      "up as he ordered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I don't know what has become of him,\" Kelson returned, manifestly\n",
      "not interested in the subject. \"I certainly should not keep open any\n",
      "longer. If Mr. Henshaw turns up at an unreasonable hour, let him wait and\n",
      "get in when he can. Don't you think so, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford nodded. \"I think, considering the hour, Mr. Dipper will be quite\n",
      "justified in locking up,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, gentlemen; I will. Goodnight,\" and the landlord departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson turned to a side table and poured out a drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Decent fellow, Dipper, and uniformly obliging,\" he said. \"I certainly\n",
      "don't see why he should be inconvenienced and kept out of his bed by that\n",
      "swanker, who has probably gone off with some pal and hasn't had the\n",
      "decency to leave word to that effect. Bad style of man altogether. Hullo!\n",
      "What's this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford crossed to Kelson, who was looking at his shirt-cuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A dark red streak was on the white linen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hanged if it doesn't look like blood,\" Kelson said, holding it to\n",
      "the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford caught his arm and scrutinized the stain.\n",
      "\n",

      "THE MISSING GUEST\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning Captain Kelson took his guest for a long drive round the\n",
      "neighbourhood. Before starting he asked the landlord at what time Henshaw\n",
      "had returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He didn't come in at all, captain,\" Dipper answered in an aggrieved\n",
      "tone. \"His fire was kept up all night for nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose he has been here this morning,\" Kelson observed casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" was the prompt reply. \"Nothing has been seen or heard of him here\n",
      "since he left last night for the ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson whistled. \"That looks rather queer, doesn't it, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford nodded. \"Very, I should say. What do you make of it?\" he asked\n",
      "the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "That worthy spread out his hands in a gesture of helplessness. \"It's\n",
      "beyond me, gentlemen. We can none of us make it out. I've never known\n",
      "anything quite like it happen all the years I've been in the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you'll have an explanation in the course of the morning all right,\"\n",
      "said Kelson with a smile at the host's worry. \"Don't take it too\n",
      "seriously; it isn't worth it. You've got Mr. Henshaw's luggage, which\n",
      "indemnifies you, and he is manifestly a person quite capable of taking\n",
      "care of himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dipper gave a doubtful jerk of the head. \"It is very mysterious all\n",
      "the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed as he went off with his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I can't get up much interest in the doings of the\n",
      "objectionable Henshaw,\" he remarked lightly as they started off. \"Such\n",
      "men as he know what they are about, and are not too punctilious with\n",
      "regard to other people's inconvenience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford responded quietly. \"All the same, his non-appearance is a\n",
      "little mysterious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson blew away the suggestion of mystery in a short,\n",
      "contemptuous laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he is probably up to some devilry with some fool of a girl,\" he\n",
      "said in an offhand tone. \"I know the type of man. They have a keen scent\n",
      "for impressionable women, of whom a fellow of that sort has always\n",
      "half-a-dozen in tow. No doubt that is what he came down here for--a\n",
      "tender adventure. That's the only kind of hunting he is keen on, take my\n",
      "word for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quite agree with you there,\" Gifford answered with conviction, and the\n",
      "subject dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they returned for luncheon they found that nothing had been heard of\n",
      "the _Golden Lion's_ missing guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is rather an extraordinary move of our friend's,\" Kelson observed\n",
      "with a laugh. \"He surely can't be living all this time in his evening\n",
      "clothes. Not but what a man like that would not let a trifle stand in his\n",
      "way if he had some scampish sport in view. No doubt he is up to a dodge\n",
      "or two by way of obviating these little difficulties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon the two friends went up to Wynford Place to call after\n",
      "the dance. Kelson had naturally been much more inclined to drive over to\n",
      "the Tredworths, about seven miles away, in order to settle his betrothal,\n",
      "but Gifford suggested that the duty call should be paid first, and so it\n",
      "was arranged. To Kelson's delight he heard that Muriel Tredworth and her\n",
      "brother were coming over next day to stay with the Morristons for another\n",
      "dance in the neighbourhood and a near meet of the hounds; so he, warming\n",
      "to the Morristons, chatted away in all a lover's high spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the way,\" he said presently, as they sat over tea, \"rather an\n",
      "extraordinary thing has happened at the _Golden Lion_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that?\" asked his host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you notice a man named Henshaw here last night? A big, dark fellow,\n",
      "probably a stranger to you, but by way of being a former follower of the\n",
      "Cumberbatch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An old fellow?\" Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no. About six-and-thirty, I should say; eh, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Under forty, certainly,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tall and very dark, almost to swarthiness; of course I remember the\n",
      "man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston exclaimed with sudden recollection. \"I introduced him to\n",
      "a partner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I noticed the fellow,\" observed Lord Painswick, who also was calling.\n",
      "\"Theatrical sort of chap. What has he done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed. \"Simply disappeared, that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Disappeared!\" There was a chorus of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you mean?\" Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Left the hotel at nine last night and has never turned up since,\" Kelson\n",
      "said with an air of telling an amusing story. \"Poor Host Dipper is taking\n",
      "it quite tragically, notwithstanding the satisfactory point in the case\n",
      "that the egregious Henshaw's elaborate kit still remains in his\n",
      "unoccupied bedroom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say he never came back all night?\" Miss Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never,\" Kelson assured her. \"Old Dipper came to us, half asleep, at four\n",
      "o'clock to ask whether he was justified in locking up the establishment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And nothing has been seen or heard of the man since,\" Gifford put in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is queer,\" Morriston said, as though scarcely knowing whether to\n",
      "take it seriously or otherwise. \"Now I come to think of it I don't\n",
      "recollect seeing anything of the man after quite the first part of the\n",
      "evening. Did you, Painswick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, can't say I did,\" Painswick answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And,\" observed Kelson, \"he was not a man to be easily overlooked when\n",
      "he was on show. I missed him, not altogether disagreeably, after the\n",
      "early dances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the idea?\" Edith Morriston inquired. \"Is there any theory to\n",
      "account for his disappearance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Kelson answered, \"unless a discreditable one. Gone off at a\n",
      "tangent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And still in his evening things?\" Painswick said with a laugh. \"Rather\n",
      "uncomfortable this weather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That reminds me,\" Morriston said with sudden animation, \"one of the\n",
      "footmen brought me a fur coat and a soft hat this morning and asked me if\n",
      "they were mine. They had been unclaimed after the dance and he had\n",
      "ascertained that they belonged to none of the men who were staying here.\n",
      "Nor were they mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is most curious,\" Kelson said with a mystified air. \"Henshaw was\n",
      "wearing a fur coat and soft hat when we saw him in the hall of the _Lion_\n",
      "just before starting. Don't you remember, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; certainly he was,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then they must be his,\" Morriston concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And where is he--without them?\" Painswick added with a laugh.\n",
      "\"Dead of cold?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is altogether quite mysterious,\" Morriston observed with a puzzled\n",
      "air. \"He can't be here still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hardly,\" his sister replied. \"You know him?\" she asked Kelson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite casually. So far as nearly coming to a rough and tumble with the\n",
      "fellow for his cheek in scoffing our fly at the station constitutes an\n",
      "acquaintance. Gifford acted as peacemaker, and we put up with the\n",
      "fellow's company to the town. But neither of us imbibed a particularly\n",
      "high opinion of the sportsman, did we, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford assented; \"his was not a taking character, to men at any\n",
      "rate; and we rather wondered how he came to be going to the\n",
      "Cumberbatch Ball.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt he got his ticket in the ordinary way,\" Morriston said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It only shows, my dear Dick,\" his sister observed, \"you may quite easily\n",
      "run risks in giving a semi-public dance in your own house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston laughed. \"Oh, come, Edith,\" he protested, \"we need not make too\n",
      "much of it. We don't know for certain that the man was a queer\n",
      "character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One finds objectionable swaggerers everywhere,\" Painswick put in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyhow,\" said Kelson, \"if this Henshaw was a bad lot he had the decency\n",
      "to efface himself promptly enough. The puzzle is, what on earth has\n",
      "become of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, Mr. Gifford,\" Morriston said as the two friends were\n",
      "leaving, \"whether you would care for a ramble over the old place. A man\n",
      "named Piercy has written to me for permission to go over the house; he\n",
      "is, it appears, writing a book on the antiquities of the county. I have\n",
      "asked him to luncheon to-morrow, and we shall be delighted if you and\n",
      "Kelson will join us as a preliminary to a personally conducted tour of\n",
      "the house. Charlie Tredworth and his sister are coming over for a week's\n",
      "stay, so we shall be quite a respectable party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally Kelson accepted the invitation with alacrity, and Gifford could\n",
      "do no less than fall in with the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hope you won't mind going over to Wynford,\" Kelson said as they drove\n",
      "back. \"If it is at all painful to you from old associations, I'll make an\n",
      "excuse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford hesitated a moment. \"Oh, no,\" he answered. \"I'll come. There is\n",
      "no use in being sentimental about the place going out of our family, and\n",
      "these Morristons are quite the right sort of people to have it. A\n",
      "splendidly thoroughbred type of girl, Miss Morriston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed. \"Oh, yes; a magnificent creature; cut out for a duchess.\n",
      "Only, you know, my dear Hugh, if I married a woman like that I should\n",
      "always be a little afraid of her. A magnificent chatelaine and all that,\n",
      "but too cold for my taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think there is no deep feeling under the ice of her manner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" Kelson replied, as though the idea was quite novel to\n",
      "him. \"Never got so far as to think of that. I like a girl with whom you\n",
      "can get on without going through the process of thawing her first. And\n",
      "with Edith Morriston I should say it would be a slow process. Anyhow, she\n",
      "is just the girl for Painswick, who is evidently after her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should say that with him the ice is a little below the surface,\"\n",
      "Gifford ventured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed. \"You've hit it, Hugh. He's easy enough, but scratch him\n",
      "and you come upon a very straight-laced aristocrat. He and the statuesque\n",
      "Edith Morriston are made for one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they entered the _Golden Lion_ the landlord met them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Mr. Dipper, any news of your missing guest?\" Kelson inquired with\n",
      "characteristic cheeriness, ignoring the troubled expression on that\n",
      "worthy's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, captain; and we can't imagine what has happened to Mr. Henshaw.\n",
      "There are three telegrams come for him, and I have just got one,\n",
      "reply-paid, to ask whether he is staying here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you replied?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Went to Hunt Ball 9 last night. Not been here since,\" Dipper quoted. \"It\n",
      "is rather awkward and unpleasant for me, sir,\" he added uncomfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you've no responsibility in the matter,\" Kelson assured him. \"Don't\n",
      "you worry about it, Mr. Dipper. If the man goes out and does not choose\n",
      "to come back, that, beyond the payment of your charges, can be no affair\n",
      "of yours. Isn't that so, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" Gifford assented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still their host looked anything but satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, that's quite right; all the same, we are beginning not to like\n",
      "the look of it. It is very mysterious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is, Mr. Dipper, to say the least of it,\" Kelson replied. \"Still from\n",
      "such opinion as we were able to form of Mr. Henshaw I don't think it\n",
      "worth while making much fuss about it. He'll turn up all right and\n",
      "probably call you a fool for your pains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not worry about it if I were you,\" Gifford said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they turned to go upstairs a telegraph boy came in and handed his\n",
      "message to the landlord, who read it and handed it to Kelson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please wire me without fail directly Mr. Henshaw returns. Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw, 8, Stone Court, Temple, London,\" Kelson read.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's his brother,\" Gifford observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" said Kelson. \"Let him worry if he likes. All you have to do,\n",
      "Mr. Dipper, is what he asks you there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went upstairs with Gifford, leaving the landlord reperusing the\n",

      "THE LOCKED ROOM\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That night the missing man did not return, nor was anything heard of him.\n",
      "The morning brought no news, and even Kelson began to think there might\n",
      "be something serious in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it was anybody but that man,\" he said casually over a hearty\n",
      "breakfast, \"I should say it would be worth while taking steps to find out\n",
      "what had become of him. But that fellow can take care of himself; and\n",
      "when you come to think of it, his coming down here, an outsider, to the\n",
      "ball, was in itself rather fishy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford agreed, and they fell to discussing the day's plans. Kelson was\n",
      "going to drive over to have the momentous interview with Miss Tredworth's\n",
      "father. He anticipated no difficulty there; still, as he said, \"The thing\n",
      "has got to be done, and the sooner it is over the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not go to-morrow?\" Gifford suggested. \"There will be rather a\n",
      "rush to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson, a man of action, scoffed at the idea. \"Oh, no; Muriel and Charlie\n",
      "are coming over to Wynford to luncheon. I shall simply get the thing\n",
      "settled and drive back with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was arranged. Gifford spent the morning in a stroll about the\n",
      "familiar neighbourhood, and when luncheon time came they all met at\n",
      "Wynford Place. Miss Morriston was not present. Her brother apologized for\n",
      "her absence, saying she had been obliged to keep an engagement to lunch\n",
      "with a friend, but that she had promised to return quite early in the\n",
      "afternoon. Mr. Piercy, the antiquarian, proved to be by no means as dry\n",
      "as his pursuit suggested. He was a lively little man with a fund of\n",
      "interesting stories furnished by the lighter side of his work, and\n",
      "altogether the luncheon was quite amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was over Morriston suggested that, not to waste the daylight,\n",
      "they should begin their tour of the house; he called upon Gifford to\n",
      "share the duties of guidance, and the party moved off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hope you haven't been bored all the morning, Hugh,\" Kelson said to his\n",

      "Has Henshaw turned up yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shook his head. \"No. Host Dipper has had another telegram of\n",
      "inquiry from the brother, but had nothing to tell him in return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson's face became grave. \"It really does begin to look serious,\"\n",
      "he remarked.\n",

      "\"Yes; Dipper has been interviewing the police on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has he? Well, I only hope Henshaw has not been playing the fool, or\n",
      "worse, and caused all this fuss for nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The party moved on to the great hall where the dancing had taken\n",
      "place, and so to the passage connecting the main building with the\n",
      "ancient tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now this is the part which will no doubt interest you most, Mr. Piercy,\"\n",
      "Morriston said; \"this fourteenth century tower, which is to-day in a\n",
      "really wonderful state of preservation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes,\" the archaeologist murmured; \"they could build in those days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They examined the two lower rooms on the ground and first floors,\n",
      "remarked on the thickness of the walls, shown by the depth of the window\n",
      "embrasures, which in older days had been put to sterner purposes; they\n",
      "admired the solid strength of the ties and hammer-beams in the roofs,\n",
      "and scrutinized the few articles of ancient furniture and tapestry the\n",
      "rooms contained, and the massive oaken iron-bound door which admitted to\n",
      "the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we will go up to the top room,\" Morriston proposed. \"It is used only\n",
      "for lumber, but there is quite a good view from it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He preceded the rest of the party up the winding stairs to the\n",
      "topmost door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, pushing at it, \"the door is locked. And the key\n",
      "appears to have been taken away,\" he added, bending down and feeling\n",
      "about in the imperfect light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole party was consequently held up on the narrow stairs. \"I'll\n",
      "go and ask what has become of the key,\" Morriston said, making his way\n",
      "past them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a minute he returned, presently followed by the butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it that this top door is locked, Stent?\" he asked. \"And where\n",
      "is the key?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, sir. Alfred mentioned this morning that the door was\n",
      "locked and the key taken away; we thought you must have locked it, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? No, I've not been up here since the morning of the ball, when I had\n",
      "those old things brought up from the lower room to be out of the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you lock the door then, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Why should I? I am certain I did not. Perhaps one of the men did.\n",
      "Just go and inquire. And have the key looked for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is rather provoking,\" Morriston said, as they waited. \"I\n",
      "particularly wanted to show you the view, which should be lovely on a\n",
      "clear day like this. If we have to wait much longer the light will be\n",
      "going. Besides, it is quite a quaint old room with a curious recess\n",
      "formed by the bartizan you may have noticed from outside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the butler returned accompanied by a footman with several keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't find the right key, sir,\" he announced. \"No one seems to\n",
      "have seen it. Alfred has brought a few like it, thinking one might\n",
      "possibly fit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "None of them, however, would go into the lock, not even the\n",
      "smallest of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't make it out, sir,\" said the man, kneeling to get more\n",
      "effectively to work. But no key would enter. The footman at last took a\n",
      "box of matches from his pocket, struck a light and, holding it to the\n",
      "key-hole, peered in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, the key is in the lock, on the other side, sir,\" he said in\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then the door can't be locked,\" Morriston said, pushing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The footman rose and pushed too, but the door showed no sign of yielding;\n",
      "it was fastened sure enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is strange,\" Morriston said. \"Hi! Is any one in there?\" he\n",
      "shouted; but no response came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure the key is in the door on the inside?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certain, sir. Will you look for yourself, sir?\" the man replied,\n",
      "striking another match and holding it so that his master could\n",
      "convince himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt about that,\" Morriston declared, as he rose from his scrutiny.\n",
      "\"It is the most extraordinary thing I have ever known. Can you account\n",
      "for it, Stent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The butler shook his head. \"No, sir. Unless someone is in there now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston again shouted, but no answer came.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I presume there is no way out of the room but this door,\" Piercy asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None,\" Morriston answered; \"except the window, and that is, I should\n",
      "say, quite eighty feet from the ground; eh, Mr. Gifford?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sheer drop of quite that distance,\" he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A prohibitive mode of exit,\" Piercy observed with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Morriston said. \"I can't understand it at all. Besides, who would\n",
      "be likely to want to play tricks here? We have had no sign of burglars,\n",
      "and in any case they would hardly have been able to bring a ladder long\n",
      "enough to reach up to that window. Well, we must have the mystery cleared\n",
      "up. I think, Stent, you had better send one of the men on a bicycle into\n",
      "Branchester to fetch a locksmith and have the door opened somehow. Have\n",
      "it explained to him that it may be a tough job. In the meantime we may as\n",
      "well go and view the tower from the outside, as we can't get in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly the whole party went down into the hall and so out to the\n",
      "garden, where they strolled round the house, Piercy meanwhile taking\n",
      "notes of its architectural features. As they came to the tower the rays\n",
      "of a late winter sun were striking it almost horizontally, lighting it up\n",
      "in a picturesque glow. Piercy, with his archaeological knowledge, was\n",
      "able to tell the owner and Gifford a good deal about the ancient\n",
      "structure of which they had previously been ignorant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The sunset would have been worth seeing from that top window,\"\n",
      "Morriston said, evidently perplexed and annoyed over the mystery of the\n",
      "locked door. \"I can't make out what has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The person who locked the door assuredly did not make his exit by the\n",
      "window,\" Kelson remarked with a laugh, as he looked up at the sheer\n",
      "surface of the upper wall; \"unless he was bent on suicide, in which case\n",
      "we should have found what was left of him at the foot of the tower.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went on round the house, Miss Morriston was seen coming up the\n",
      "drive. Her brother hurried forward to meet her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, Edith,\" he exclaimed, \"we are in a great fix. Can you explain\n",
      "how the door of the top room in the tower comes to be locked with the\n",
      "key inside?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston looked surprised. \"What, Dick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't get in,\" Morriston explained. \"We found the door locked and the\n",
      "key missing, and then when Alfred tried another key, he found the right\n",
      "one was in the lock but inside the room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston thought a moment. \"My dear Dick, the door can't be\n",
      "locked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is, I tell you,\" he returned; \"most certainly locked. We have tried\n",
      "it and found it quite fast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then there must be someone in the room,\" his sister said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" Morriston replied, \"seems the only possible explanation. But I\n",
      "shouted several times and got no answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Someone playing you a trick,\" and the girl laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who? who?\" he returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister gave a shrug. \"Oh, you'll find out soon enough,\" she replied,\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall,\" he replied, as two men appeared making for the servants'\n",
      "entrance. \"Here comes Henry with the locksmith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston in her stately way looked amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear old Dick, you have been making a fuss about it. You will\n",
      "probably find the door open when you go up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I'll know who has been playing this stupid trick,\" Morriston said\n",
      "wrathfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A footman making love to a housemaid turned the key in a panic at being\n",
      "trapped,\" Kelson said to his host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say,\" Morriston replied with a laugh of ill-humour. \"And he'll\n",
      "have to pay for his impudence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That explanation by its feasibility was generally accepted as the simple\n",
      "solution of the mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along!\" Morriston called. \"We'll all go up, and see whether the\n",
      "door is open or not. We shall just be in time to catch the sunset.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He led the way through the hall and the corridor beyond and so up the\n",
      "winding stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, not open yet?\" he exclaimed as the last turn showed the workman\n",
      "busy at the lock. \"Well, this is extraordinary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The locksmith was kneeling and working at the door, while the footman\n",
      "stood over him holding a candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The key is in the lock, inside, isn't it?\" Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" the man answered. \"There is no doubt about that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you account for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked up from his task and shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't account for it, sir. Unless so be as there is someone inside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you open it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. I'll have it turned in a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took from his bag a long pair of hollow pliers which he inserted in\n",
      "the lock and then screwed tightly, clutching the end of the key. Then\n",
      "fitting a transverse rod to the pliers and using it as a lever he\n",
      "carefully forced the key round, and so shot back the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a short pause while the man unscrewed his instrument; then he\n",
      "stepped back and pushed open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston went in quickly. \"There is the key, sure enough,\" he said,\n",
      "looking round at the inside of the door. He took a couple of steps\n",
      "farther into the room, only to utter an exclamation of intense surprise\n",
      "and horror; then turned quickly with an almost scared face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go back!\" he cried hoarsely, holding up his hands with an arresting\n",
      "gesture. \"Kelson, Mr. Gifford, come here a moment and shut the door.\n",
      "Look!\" he said in a breathless whisper, pointing to the floor beneath the\n",
      "window through which the deep orange light of the declining sun was\n",
      "streaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "An exclamation came from Kelson as he saw the object which Morriston\n",
      "indicated, and he turned with a stupefied look to Gifford. \"My--!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford's teeth were set and he fell a step backward as though in\n",
      "repulsion. On the floor between the window and an old oak table which had\n",
      "practically hidden it from the doorway, lay the body of a man in evening\n",
      "clothes, one side of his shirt-front stained a dark colour. Although the\n",
      "face lay in the shadow of the high window-sill, there was no mistaking\n",
      "the man's identity.\n",
      "\n",

      "THE MYSTERY OF CLEMENT HENSHAW\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the missing man, Henshaw, sure enough. The swarthy hue of his face\n",
      "had in death turned almost to black, but the features, together with the\n",
      "man's big, muscular figure were unmistakable. For some moments the three\n",
      "men stood looking at the body in something like bewilderment, scarcely\n",
      "realizing that so terrible a tragedy had been enacted in that place, amid\n",
      "those surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suicide?\" Kelson was the first to break the silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must have been,\" Morriston responded \"or how could the door have been\n",
      "locked from the inside. I will send at once for the police, and we must\n",
      "have a doctor, although that is obviously useless.\" He went to the door,\n",
      "then turned. \"Will you stay here or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson made an irresolute movement as though wavering between the\n",
      "implied invitation to quit the room and an inclination not to run\n",
      "away from the grim business. He glanced at Gifford, who showed no\n",
      "sign of moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you like,\" he replied in a hushed voice. \"Perhaps we had better\n",
      "stay here till you come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" Morriston assented. \"Don't let any one come in, and I\n",
      "suppose we ought not to move anything in the room till the police\n",
      "have seen it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went out, closing the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't make this out, Hugh,\" Kelson said, pulling himself together and\n",
      "moving to the opposite side of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford responded mechanically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He,\" Kelson continued, \"certainly did not give one the idea of a man who\n",
      "had come down here to make away with himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" his friend murmured in the same preoccupied tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think? How can you account for it?\" Kelson demanded, as\n",
      "appealing to the other's greater knowledge of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to be with an effort that Gifford released himself from the\n",
      "fascination that held his gaze to the tragedy. \"It is an absolute\n",
      "mystery,\" he replied, moving to where his friend stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A woman in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Gifford did not answer. Then he said, \"No doubt about it, I\n",
      "should imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's awful,\" Kelson said, driven, perhaps for the first time in his\n",
      "life, from his habitually casual way of regarding serious things, and\n",
      "maybe roused by Gifford's apathy. \"We didn't like--the man did not appeal\n",
      "to us; but to die like this. It's horrible. And I dare say it happened\n",
      "while the dance was in full swing down there. Why, man, Muriel and I were\n",
      "in the room below. I proposed to her there. And all the time this was\n",
      "just above us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is horrible; one doesn't like to think of it,\" Gifford said\n",
      "reticently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot understand it,\" Kelson went on, with a sharp gesture of\n",
      "perplexity. \"I can imagine some sort of love affair bringing the poor\n",
      "fellow down to this place; but that he should come up here and do this\n",
      "thing, even if it went wrong, is more than I can conceive. Taking the man\n",
      "as we knew him it is out of all reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford assented. \"But we don't know yet that it is a case\n",
      "of suicide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else?\" Kelson returned. \"How otherwise could the door have been\n",
      "locked. Unless--\" He glanced sharply at the deep recess, or inner\n",
      "chamber, formed by the bartizan, hesitated a moment, and then going\n",
      "quickly to it, looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, nothing there,\" he announced with a breath of relief. \"I had for\n",
      "the moment an idea it might have been a double tragedy,\" he added with\n",
      "a shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we are forced back to the suicide theory,\" Gifford remarked. He had\n",
      "gone to the landing outside the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Kelson replied as he joined him. \"But as to the woman in the case,\n",
      "who could she possibly have been? I knew most of the girls who were at\n",
      "the dance, and the idea of a tragedy with any one of them seems\n",
      "inconceivable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One would think so,\" Gifford responded. \"And yet--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think it possible?\" Kelson demanded incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possible, if far from probable,\" the other answered with conviction.\n",
      "\"There are women who can be as secret as the grave, at any rate so far as\n",
      "appearances to the outer world are concerned. I wonder whom he danced\n",
      "with. Do you remember?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I seem to recollect him with a girl in a light green dress, but that\n",
      "does not take us far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Footsteps on the stairway announced their host's return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The police will be here, directly,\" he reported, \"and, I hope, a doctor.\n",
      "I have done my best to keep it from the ladies, and I don't think that,\n",
      "so far, any of them has an exact idea of what made me turn them back.\n",
      "Just as well the horror should be kept dark as long as possible. It is\n",
      "such an awful blow to me that I can scarcely realize it yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Morriston does not know?\" Kelson asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. And I only hope it won't give her a dislike to the house when\n",
      "she does. For I am hoping to have her here a good deal with me, even\n",
      "if she marries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A police inspector accompanied by a detective and a constable now\n",
      "arrived. Morriston took them into the room of death. Gifford grasped\n",
      "Kelson's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think there is any use in our staying here,\" he suggested. \"Let\n",
      "us go down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other man nodded, and they began to descend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not going, Kelson?\" Morriston cried, hurrying to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We thought we could be of no use and might be in the way,\"\n",
      "Gifford replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I wish you would stay,\" Morriston urged, going down a few steps to\n",
      "them. \"I know it is not pleasant; on the contrary it's a ghastly affair;\n",
      "but I should like to have you with me till this police business is over.\n",
      "I won't ask you to stay up here, but if you don't mind waiting downstairs\n",
      "I should be so grateful. I might want your advice. You'll find the rest\n",
      "of the party in the drawing-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two could do no less than promise, and, with a word of thanks,\n",
      "Morriston went back to the officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the two men crossed the hall the drawing-room door opened and Miss\n",
      "Morriston came out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is my brother coming?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will be down soon,\" Gifford answered in as casual a tone as he\n",
      "could assume.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl seemed struck by the gravity of their faces as she glanced from\n",
      "one to the other. \"I hope nothing is wrong,\" she observed, with just a\n",
      "shade of apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a momentary pause as each man, hesitating between a direct\n",
      "falsehood, the truth, and a plausible excuse, rather waited for the\n",
      "other to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford answered. \"No, nothing that you need worry about, Miss Morriston.\n",
      "Your brother will tell you later on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the hesitation seemed to have aroused the girl's suspicions. \"Do tell\n",
      "me now,\" she said, with just a tremor of anxiety underlying the\n",
      "characteristic coldness of her tone. \"Unless,\" she added, \"it is\n",
      "something not exactly proper for me to hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson quickly availed himself of the loophole she gave him. \"You had\n",
      "better wait and hear it from Dick,\" he said, suggesting a move towards\n",
      "the drawing-room. \"In the meantime there is nothing you need be\n",
      "alarmed about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It all sounds very mysterious,\" Miss Morriston returned, her\n",
      "apprehension scarcely hidden by a forced smile. \"I must go and ask\n",
      "Dick--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she turned towards the passage leading to the tower Kelson sprang\n",
      "forward and intercepted her. \"No, no, Miss Morriston,\" he remonstrated\n",
      "with a prohibiting gesture, \"don't go up there now. Take my word for it\n",
      "you had better not. Dick will be down directly to explain what is wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few moments her eyes rested on him searchingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" she said at length. \"If you say I ought not to go, I won't.\n",
      "But you don't lessen my anxiety to know what has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no particular cause for anxiety on your part,\" Kelson said\n",
      "reassuringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had turned and now led the way to the drawing-room. As they entered\n",
      "they were received by expectant looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, is the mystery solved?\" young Tredworth inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson gave him a silencing look. \"You'll hear all about it in good\n",
      "time,\" he replied between lightness and gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piercy rose to take his leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you must not go yet,\" Miss Morriston protested. \"They are just\n",
      "bringing tea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I fear I may be in the way if there is anything--\" he urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" his hostess insisted. \"I don't know of anything wrong. At least\n",
      "neither Captain Kelson nor Mr. Gifford will admit anything. You must have\n",
      "tea before your long drive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject of the mystery in the tower was tacitly dropped, perhaps from\n",
      "a vague feeling that it was best not alluded to, at any rate by the\n",
      "ladies, and the conversation flowed, with more or less effort, on\n",
      "ordinary local topics. Tea over, Piercy took his leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must come again, Mr. Piercy, while you are in this part of the\n",
      "county,\" Miss Morriston said graciously, \"when you shall have no\n",
      "episodes of lost keys to hinder your researches. My brother shall\n",
      "write to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson took the departing visitor out into the hall to see him off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll see it all in the papers to-morrow, I expect,\" he said in a\n",
      "confidential tone, \"so there is no harm in telling you there has been\n",
      "a most gruesome discovery in that locked room. A man who was here at\n",
      "the Hunt Ball, has been found dead; suicide no doubt. The police are\n",
      "here now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens! A mercy the ladies did not see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; they'll have to know sooner or later. The later the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed. Any idea of the cause of the sad business?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None, as yet. A complete mystery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably a woman in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not unlikely. Good-bye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Kelson turned from the door, Morriston and another man appeared at the\n",
      "farther end of the hall and called to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know Dr. Page,\" he said as Kelson joined them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A terrible business this, doctor,\" Kelson observed as they shook hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The medico drew in a breath. \"And at first sight in the highest degree\n",
      "mysterious,\" he said gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Page,\" said Morriston, \"has made a cursory examination of the\n",
      "body. The autopsy will take place elsewhere. The police are making\n",
      "notes of everything important, and after dark will remove the body\n",
      "quietly by the tower door. So I hope the ladies will know nothing of\n",
      "the tragedy just yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were speaking a footman had opened the hall-door and now\n",
      "approached with a card on a salver. \"Can you see this gentleman,\n",
      "sir?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston took the card, and as he glanced at it an expression of pain\n",
      "crossed his face. He handed it silently to Kelson, who gave it back with\n",
      "a grave nod. It was the card of \"Mr. Gervase Henshaw, II Stone Court,\n",

      "\"Show Mr. Henshaw into the library,\" Morriston said to the footman. \"This\n",
      "is horribly tragic,\" he added in a low tone to Kelson, \"but it has to be\n",
      "gone through, and perhaps the sooner the better. His brother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he mentioned him on our way from the station the other evening. At\n",
      "any rate he will be able to see the situation for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will come with me?\" Morriston suggested. \"You might fetch your\n",

      "\n",
      "Morriston led the way to the library. By the fire stood a keen-featured,\n",
      "sharp-eyed man of middle height and lithe figure, whose manner and first\n",
      "movements as the door opened showed alertness and energy of character.\n",
      "There was a certain likeness to his brother in the features and dark\n",
      "complexion as well as in a suggestion of unpleasant aggressiveness in the\n",
      "expression of his face, but where the dead man's personality had\n",
      "suggested determination overlaid with an easy-going, indulgent spirit of\n",
      "hedonism this man seemed to bristle with a restless mental activity, to\n",
      "be all brain; one whose pleasures lay manifestly on the intellectual\n",
      "side. One thing Gifford quickly noted, as he looked at the man with a\n",
      "painful curiosity, was that the face before him lacked much of the\n",
      "suggestion of evil which in the brother he had found so repellent. This\n",
      "man could surely be hard enough on occasion, the strong jaw and a\n",
      "certain hardness in the eyes told that, but except perhaps for an\n",
      "uncomfortable excess of sharpness, there was none of his brother's rather\n",
      "brutally scoffing cast of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw seemed to regard the two men following Morriston into the room\n",
      "with a certain apprehensive surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you will pardon my troubling you like this,\" he said to\n",
      "Morriston, speaking in a quick, decided tone, \"but I have been rather\n",
      "anxious as to what has become of my brother, of whom I can get no news.\n",
      "He came down to the Cumberbatch Hunt Ball, which I understand was held in\n",
      "this house, and from that evening seems to have mysteriously disappeared.\n",
      "He had an important business engagement for the next day, Wednesday,\n",
      "which he failed to keep, and this may mean a considerable loss to him.\n",
      "Can you throw any light on his movements down here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston, dreading to break the news abruptly, had not interrupted his\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say I can,\" he now answered in a subdued tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry?\" Henshaw caught up the word quickly. \"What do you mean? Has he\n",
      "met with an accident?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse than that,\" Morriston answered sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw with a start fell back a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse,\" he repeated. \"You don't mean to say--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dead!\" Surprise and shock raised the word almost to a shout. \"You--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have,\" Morriston said quietly, \"only discovered the terrible truth\n",
      "within the last hour or so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But dead?\" Henshaw protested incredulously. \"How--how can he be dead?\n",
      "How did he die? An accident?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid it looks as though by his own hand,\" Morriston answered in a\n",
      "hushed voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression of incredulity on Henshaw's face manifestly deepened. \"By\n",
      "his own hand?\" he echoed. \"Suicide? Clement commit suicide? Impossible!\n",
      "Inconceivable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One would think so indeed,\" Morriston replied with sympathy. \"May I tell\n",
      "you the facts, so far as we know them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" The words were rapped out almost peremptorily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston pointed to a chair, but his visitor, in his preoccupation,\n",
      "seemed to take no notice of the gesture, continuing to stand restlessly,\n",
      "in an attitude of strained attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other three men had seated themselves. Morriston without further\n",
      "preface related the story of the locked door in the tower and of the\n",
      "subsequent discovery when it had been opened. Henshaw heard him to the\n",
      "end in what seemed a mood of hardly restrained, somewhat resentful\n",
      "impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand it at all,\" he said when the story was finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor do any of us,\" Morriston returned promptly. \"The whole affair is\n",
      "as mysterious as it is lamentable. Still it appears to be clearly a\n",
      "case of suicide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suicide!\" Henshaw echoed with a certain scornful incredulity. \"Why\n",
      "suicide? In connexion with my brother the idea seems utterly\n",
      "preposterous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The door locked on the inside,\" Morriston suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That, I grant you, is at first sight mysterious enough,\" Henshaw\n",
      "returned, his keen eyes fixed on Morriston. \"But even that does not\n",
      "reconcile me to the monstrous improbability of my brother, Clement,\n",
      "taking his own life. I knew him too well to admit that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" Morriston replied, sympathetically restraining any\n",
      "approach to an argumentative tone, \"your brother was practically a\n",
      "stranger to me, and to us all. My friends here, Captain Kelson and Mr.\n",
      "Gifford, met him casually at the railway station and drove with him to\n",
      "the _Golden Lion_ in the town, where they all put up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw's sharp scrutiny was immediately transferred from Morriston to\n",
      "his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you, gentlemen, throw any light on the matter?\" he asked sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None at all, I am sorry to say,\" Kelson answered readily. \"I may as well\n",
      "tell you how our very slight acquaintance with him came about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please,\" Henshaw responded, in a tone more of command than\n",
      "request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson, naturally ignoring his questioner's slightly offensive manner,\n",
      "thereupon related the circumstances of the encounter at the station-yard\n",
      "and of the subsequent drive to the town, merely softening the detail of\n",
      "their preliminary altercation. Henshaw listened alertly intent, it\n",
      "seemed, to seize upon any point which did not satisfy him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was all you saw of my unfortunate brother?\" he demanded at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We saw him for a few moments in the hall of the hotel just as we were\n",
      "starting,\" Kelson answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You drove here together? No?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; your brother took an hotel carriage, and I drove in my own trap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With Mr. ----?\" he indicated Gifford, who up to this point had\n",
      "not spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford answered. \"I came on later. A suit-case with my evening\n",
      "things had gone astray--been carried on in the train, and I had to wait\n",
      "till it was returned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw stared at him for a moment sharply as though the statement had\n",
      "about it something vaguely suspicious, seemed about to put another\n",
      "question, checked himself, and turned about with a gesture of perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand it at all,\" he muttered. Then suddenly facing round\n",
      "again he said sharply to Gifford, \"Have you anything to add, sir, to what\n",
      "your friend has told me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can say nothing more,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw turned away again, and seemed as though but half satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The facts,\" he said in a lawyer-like tone, \"don't appear to lead us far.\n",
      "But when ascertained facts stop short they may be supplemented. Apart\n",
      "from what is actually known--I ask this as the dead man's only\n",
      "brother--have either of you gentlemen formed any idea as to how he came\n",
      "by his death?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was looking at Morriston, his cross-examining manner now softened by\n",
      "the human touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has not occurred to me to look beyond what seems the obvious\n",
      "explanation of suicide,\" Morriston answered frankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw turned to Kelson. \"And you, sir; have you any idea beyond the\n",
      "known facts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None,\" was the answer, \"except that he took his own life. The door\n",
      "locked on--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw interrupted him sharply. \"Now you are getting back to the facts,\n",
      "Captain Kelson. I tell you the idea of my brother Clement taking his own\n",
      "life is to me absolutely inconceivable. Have you any idea, however\n",
      "far-fetched, as to what really may have happened?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson shook his head. \"None. Except I must say he looked to me the last\n",
      "man who would do such an act.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think so,\" Henshaw returned decidedly. Then he addressed\n",
      "himself to Gifford. \"I must ask you, sir, the same question.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I can give you no more satisfactory answer,\" Gifford said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a man with knowledge of the world as I take you to be?\" Henshaw\n",
      "urged keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least you agree with your friend here, that my poor brother did not\n",
      "strike one as being a man liable to make away with himself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly. But one can never tell. I knew nothing of him or his\n",
      "affairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I did,\" Henshaw retorted vehemently. \"And I tell you, gentlemen, the\n",
      "thing is utterly impossible. But we shall see. The body--is it here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The police have charge of it in the room where he was found. It is to be\n",
      "removed at nightfall. You will wish to see it?\" Morriston answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston led the way to the tower, explaining as he went the\n",
      "arrangements on the night of the ball. Henshaw spoke little, his mood\n",
      "seemed dissatisfied and resentful, but his sharp eyes seemed to take\n",
      "everything in. Once he asked, \"Did my brother dance much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was introduced to a partner,\" Morriston replied. \"But after that no\n",
      "one seems to have noticed him in the ball-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean he disappeared quite early in the evening?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; so far as we have been able to ascertain,\" Morriston answered.\n",
      "\"Naturally, before this awful discovery we had been much exercised by\n",
      "his mysterious disappearance and failure to return to the hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the same,\" Henshaw returned sourly, \"one can hardly accept the\n",
      "inference that he came down here for the express purpose of making away\n",
      "with himself in your house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I cannot understand it,\" Morriston replied, as he turned and began\n",
      "to ascend the winding stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the threshold of the topmost floor he paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the door we found locked on the inside,\" he observed quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw gave a keen look round, and nodded. Morriston pushed open the\n",
      "door and they entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body of Clement Henshaw still lay on the floor in charge of the\n",
      "detective and the inspector, the third man having been despatched to\n",
      "the town to make arrangements for its removal. With a nod to the\n",
      "officials, Henshaw advanced to the body and bent over it. \"Poor\n",
      "Clement!\" he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few moments' scrutiny, Henshaw turned to the officers. \"I am the\n",
      "brother of the deceased,\" he said, addressing more particularly the\n",
      "detective. \"What do you make of this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was put in the same sharp, business-like tone which had\n",
      "characterized his utterances in the library.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Judging by the door being locked on the inside,\" the detective answered\n",
      "sympathetically, \"it can only be a case of suicide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw frowned. \"It will take a good deal to persuade me of that,\" he\n",
      "retorted. \"Mr. ----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Detective-Sergeant Finch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Finch. Did the doctor say suicide?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not hear him express a definite opinion. Did you, inspector?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Finch. I rather presumed the doctor took it for granted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Took it for granted!\" Henshaw echoed contemptuously. \"I'm not going to\n",
      "take it for granted, I can tell you. Did the doctor examine the body?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He made a cursory examination. He is arranging to meet the police\n",
      "surgeon for an autopsy to-morrow morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the table lay a narrow-bladed chisel, the lower portion of the bright\n",
      "steel discoloured with the dark stain of blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inspector pointed to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the instrument with which the wound must have been made,\" he\n",
      "remarked in a subdued tone. \"It was found lying beside the body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw took it up and ran his eyes over it. \"How could he have got\n",
      "this?\" he demanded, looking round with what seemed a distrustful glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can only suggest,\" Morriston answered, \"that one of my men must have\n",
      "left it when some work was done here a few days ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is so apparently, Mr. Morriston,\" the detective corroborated. \"It\n",
      "has been identified by Haynes, the estate carpenter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw put down the chisel and for some moments kept silence, tightening\n",
      "his thin lips as though in strenuous thought. Then suddenly he demanded,\n",
      "\"Beyond the fact that the door was found locked from within, what reason\n",
      "have you for your conclusion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Finch shrugged. \"We don't see how it could be otherwise, sir,\" he\n",
      "replied with quiet conviction. \"Clearly the deceased gentleman must have\n",
      "been alone in the room when he died.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Might he not have locked the door after the wound was given?\" Henshaw\n",
      "suggested in a tone of cross-examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Page was of opinion that death, or at any rate unconsciousness, must\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Even supposing the autopsy bears out that view I shall not be\n",
      "satisfied,\" Henshaw declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inspector took up the argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, sir, taking into consideration the position of the room it\n",

      "passing through, would mean pretty certain death. Anyhow the party would\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Was the window found open or shut?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was found unlatched, sir,\" Finch answered. \"But the servants think\n",

      "Henshaw kept silence, seemingly indifferent to the officials' arguments.\n",
      "\"I can only tell you I am far from satisfied with the suicide theory,\" he\n",
      "said at length. \"My brother was not that sort of man. He had nerves of\n",
      "iron; he was in love with life and all it meant to him, and he made it a\n",

      "He turned towards the door, and as he did so he caught sight of a\n",

      "and rapidly ran his eye through its contents. Then he gave a curious\n",
      "laugh, as he turned over the paper as though seeking an address, and laid\n",
      "it back in the box.\n",

      "KELSON'S PERPLEXITY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think of Mr. Gervase Henshaw?\" Kelson said, as, late in the\n",
      "afternoon, he and Gifford walked towards the town together. Henshaw had\n",
      "left Wynford Place half an hour previously, having kept to the end his\n",
      "attitude of resentful incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nailer,\" Gifford answered shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Kelson agreed. \"He gives one the idea of a man who will make\n",
      "trouble if he can. As offensive as his brother was, I should say,\n",
      "although in a different line. I did not detect one sign of any\n",
      "consideration for the Morristons in their horribly unpleasant position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford agreed. \"I was very sorry for Morriston. He behaved\n",
      "extremely well, considering the irritatingly antagonistic line the man\n",
      "chose to take up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brainy man, Henshaw; unpleasantly sharp, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford replied. \"Added to his legal training he is by way of\n",
      "being an expert in criminology.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do hope,\" Kelson remarked thoughtfully, \"he is not going to make\n",
      "himself unpleasant down here. The scandal will be quite enough without\n",
      "that. Horribly rough luck on the Morristons as new-comers here to have an\n",
      "affair like this happening in their house. I can't think what brought the\n",
      "man down here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he came with a purpose, that's certain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A woman in it, no doubt. One can quite sympathize with the brother's\n",
      "incredulity as to the suicide theory, though hardly with his manner of\n",
      "showing it. The dead man was not that sort. The idea is simply\n",
      "staggering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford made no response, and for a while they walked on in silence.\n",
      "Presently he asked, \"How did you get on to-day--I mean with Colonel\n",
      "Tredworth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, everything went off beautifully,\" Kelson answered, his tone\n",
      "brightening with the change of subject. \"The old boy gave me his consent\n",
      "and his blessing. I've scarcely been able as yet to appreciate my luck,\n",
      "with this affair at Wynford Place intervening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford responded mechanically. \"It is calculated to drive\n",
      "everything else out of one's head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is suggested,\" said Kelson, \"that we should be married quite soon.\n",
      "The Tredworths are going abroad next month and don't propose to hurry\n",
      "back. So it means that if the wedding does not take place before they\n",
      "leave it must be postponed till probably the autumn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think the latter would be the best plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson turned quickly to his companion. \"To postpone it?\" he exclaimed in\n",
      "a rather hurt tone. \"Why on earth should we? We have nothing to wait for,\n",
      "I mean money or anything of that sort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but settlements take a long time to draw up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if the lawyers are told to hurry up with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you will have to find a house, and get furniture. And there is the\n",
      "trousseau,\" Gifford urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Kelson returned with a show of impatience, \"all these details can\n",
      "be got over in two or three weeks if we set ourselves to do it. I don't\n",
      "believe in waiting once the thing is settled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe in rushing matters,\" Gifford rejoined. \"Least of all\n",
      "matrimony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson stopped dead. \"Why, Hugh,\" he said in an expostulatory tone, \"what\n",
      "is the matter with you? You are most confoundedly unsympathetic. Any one\n",
      "would think you did not want me to marry the girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly don't want you to be in too great a hurry,\" Gifford\n",

      "\"But why? Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel it is a mistake.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hardly. But why not wait till the family returns? Of course it is no\n",
      "business of mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Kelson replied with a laugh of annoyance; \"and you can't be\n",
      "expected to enter into my feelings on the subject. But I think you might\n",
      "be a little less grudging of your sympathy.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "your own interest that I counsel you not to be in a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why? What, in heaven's name, do you mean?\" Kelson demanded, vaguely\n",
      "apprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a mistake to rush things, that is all,\" was the\n",
      "unsatisfactory answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I saw the slightest chance of danger I would not hesitate to take\n",
      "your advice,\" Kelson said. \"But I don't. Nor do you. Since when have you\n",
      "become so cautious?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford forced a laugh. \"It is coming on with age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson clapped him on the shoulder. \"Don't encourage it, my dear Hugh. It\n",
      "will spoil all the enjoyment in your life, and in other people's too, if\n",
      "you force the note. I promise you I won't hurry on the wedding more than\n",
      "is absolutely necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" Gifford responded, and the subject dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had finished dinner, at which the absorbing subject of the tragedy\n",
      "at Wynford Place was the main topic of their conversation, when the\n",
      "landlord came in to say that Mr. Gervase Henshaw, who was staying at the\n",
      "hotel, would like to see them if they were disengaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson looked across at his friend. \"Shall we see him?\"\n",

      "worrying Morriston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ask Mr. Henshaw up,\" Kelson said to the landlord, and in a minute he was\n",
      "ushered in.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a quick, decisive movement Henshaw took the seat to which Kelson\n",
      "invited him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I trust you won't think me intrusive, gentlemen,\" he began in his sharp\n",
      "mode of speaking, \"but you will understand I am very much upset and\n",
      "horribly perplexed by the terrible fate which has overtaken my poor\n",
      "brother. I am setting myself to search for a clue, if ever so slight, to\n",
      "the mystery, the double mystery, I may say, and it occurred to me that\n",
      "perhaps a talk with you gentlemen who are, so far, the last known\n",
      "persons who spoke with him, might possibly give me a hint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid there is very little we can tell you,\" Gifford replied. \"But\n",
      "we are at your service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.\" It seemed the first civil word of acknowledgment they had\n",
      "heard him utter. \"First of all,\" he proceeded, falling back to his dry,\n",
      "lawyer-like tone, \"I have been to see the medical man who was summoned to\n",
      "look at the body, Dr. Page. He tells me that, so far as his cursory\n",
      "examination went, the position of the wound hardly suggests that it was\n",
      "self-inflicted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he sure of it?\" Kelson asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't be positive till he has made the autopsy,\" Henshaw answered.\n",
      "\"He merely suggests that it was a very awkward and altogether unlikely\n",
      "place for a man to wound himself. Anyhow that guarded opinion is enough\n",
      "to strengthen my inclination to scout the idea of suicide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said Kelson, \"we are faced by the difficulty of the locked door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw made a gesture of indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That at first sight presents a problem, I admit,\" he said, \"but not so\n",
      "complete as to look absolutely insoluble. I have, as you may be aware,\n",
      "made a study of criminology, and in my researches, which have included\n",
      "criminality, have come across incidents which to the smartest detective\n",
      "brains were at the outset quite as baffling. Clement's tragic end is a\n",
      "great blow to me, and I am not going quietly to accept the easy, obvious\n",
      "conclusion of suicide. I knew and appreciated my brother better than\n",
      "that. I mean to probe this business to the bottom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be justified,\" Kelson murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so--by the result,\" was the quick rejoinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford spoke. \"What do you think was the real object in your brother\n",
      "coming down here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw looked at his questioner keenly before he answered. \"It is my\n",
      "opinion, my conviction, there was a lady in the case. May I ask what\n",
      "prompted you to ask the question?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shrugged. \"Some idea of the sort was in my own mind,\" he replied,\n",
      "with a reserve which could scarcely be satisfying to Henshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" he said keenly, \"you have also an idea who the lady was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shook his head. \"Not at all,\" he returned promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why should the idea have suggested itself to you,\" came the\n",
      "cross-examining rejoinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your brother was not a member of the Hunt, and it seemed to\n",
      "us--curious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw took him up quickly. \"That he should come to the ball? No doubt.\n",
      "I will be perfectly frank with you, as I expect you to be with me. It is\n",
      "perhaps not quite seemly to discuss my brother's failings at this time,\n",
      "but we want to get at the truth about his death. He had, I fear, rather\n",
      "irregular methods in his treatment of women. One can hardly blame him,\n",
      "poor fellow. His was a fascinating personality, at any rate so far as\n",
      "women were concerned. They ran after him, and one can scarcely blame him\n",
      "if he acquired a derogatory opinion of them. After all, he held them no\n",
      "cheaper than they made themselves in his eyes. That note I looked at\n",
      "which came from his pocket was written by him to make an assignation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was it addressed?\" Gifford put the question quickly, almost eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Henshaw answered. \"I wish it had been. In that case we should be\n",
      "near the end of the mystery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson was staring at the glib speaker with astounded eyes. \"Do you\n",
      "suppose a woman killed your brother?\" he almost gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such things have been known,\" Henshaw returned with the flicker of an\n",
      "enigmatical smile. \"But no, I don't suggest that--yet. At present I have\n",
      "got no farther than the conviction that Clement did not kill himself. I\n",
      "mean to find out for whom that note of his was intended.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not an easy task,\" Gifford remarked, with his eye furtively on Kelson,\n",
      "who had become strangely interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may or may not be easy,\" Henshaw returned. \"But it is to be done. The\n",
      "woman who, intentionally or otherwise, drew my brother down here has to\n",
      "be found, and I mean to find her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson was now staring almost stupidly at Gifford.\n",
      "\n",

      "sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw nothing of him at all in the ballroom,\" Gifford answered,\n",
      "\"as I did not arrive till about midnight. Did you see him, Harry?\" he\n",
      "asked, as though with the design of rousing Kelson from his rather\n",
      "suspicious attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson seemed to pull himself together by an effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--yes; I caught a glimpse of him, I think, with a girl in green.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know who she was?\" Henshaw demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've not the vaguest idea,\" Kelson answered mechanically. \"I did not see\n",
      "her face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw rose. Perhaps from Kelson's manner he gathered that the men were\n",
      "tired, and had had enough of him. He shook hands, with a word of thanks\n",
      "and an apology. \"We may know more after the inquest to-morrow afternoon,\"\n",
      "he remarked, \"although I doubt it. You will let me consult you again, if\n",
      "necessary? Thanks. Goodnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the door closed on Henshaw, Kelson turned quickly to Gifford with a\n",
      "scared face. \"Hugh!\" he cried hoarsely, in a voice subdued by fear. \"The\n",
      "blood stain on my cuff that night. How did it come there? Was it--?\"\n",

      "Gifford forced a smile. \"My dear Harry, how absurd! What could that have\n",

      "At the inquest which was held next day nothing was elicited which could\n",
      "offer any solution of the mystery of Clement Henshaw's death. It seemed\n",
      "to be pretty generally accepted to be a case of suicide, although that\n",
      "view was opposed in evidence, not only by Gervase Henshaw on general\n",
      "grounds, but also by the medical witnesses, who had grave doubts whether\n",
      "the mortal wound had been self-inflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just possible but decidedly improbable, both from the position of the\n",
      "wound and the direction of the blow,\" was Dr. Page's opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a downward, oblique stab in the throat which had pierced the\n",
      "larynx and penetrated the jugular vein. The deceased would have been\n",
      "unable to cry out and would probably have quickly become insensible from\n",

      "back with him to Wynford Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us throw off this depressing business as well as we can,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Of course I have had to break it to my sister and the others; they would\n",
      "have seen it to-day in print. Thank goodness the papers don't look beyond\n",
      "the suicide idea, so they are not making much fuss about it. If they took\n",
      "a more sensational view, as I fear they will now after the medical\n",
      "evidence, it would be a terrible nuisance.\"\n",

      "\"I hope the ladies were not much upset when you told them,\"\n",
      "Gifford remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they already had an idea that something was seriously wrong, and\n",
      "that took the edge off the announcement. Of course they were horribly\n",
      "shocked at the idea of the tragedy so close at hand, though I softened\n",
      "the details as well as I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the suicide idea is to be abandoned,\" said Kelson, speaking with an\n",

      "keen person, the brother, will keep them up to collar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He means to,\" Kelson replied rather grimly. \"We had him for an hour\n",

      "him nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't leave a stone unturned,\" Morriston said. \"He proposes to return\n",
      "here after the funeral in town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I should say,\" observed Kelson, \"if the mystery is to be solved he\n",
      "is the man to solve it. What do you think, Hugh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford seemed to rouse himself by an effort from an absorbing train of\n",
      "thought. \"Oh, yes,\" he answered. \"Except that it is possible to be a\n",
      "little too clever and so overlook the obvious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If,\" said Morriston, obsessed by the subject, \"the case is not one of\n",
      "suicide it must be one of murder. Where is Mr. Gervase Henshaw, or any\n",
      "one else, going to look for the criminal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not among your guests, let's hope,\" Kelson said with a touch of\n",
      "uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For one thing,\" Morriston replied, \"they, or a good part of them, were\n",
      "not exactly my guests. I can't tell who may have got a ticket and been\n",
      "present. There was a great crowd. We may have easily rubbed shoulders\n",
      "with the murderer, if murder it was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, so we may,\" said Kelson alertly, though with something of a\n",
      "shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a pleasant idea,\" continued Morriston. \"But I don't see, if a bad\n",
      "character did get in and mix with the company, why he should have done a\n",
      "fellow guest to death, nor how he contrived to leave his victim and get\n",
      "out of the room after he had locked the door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the two men had a row over a girl, or anything else,\" Kelson said,\n",
      "\"there is still that difficulty to be surmounted.\"\n",

      "Gifford spoke. \"From what one could judge of the dead man's personality\n",
      "and character it is not a far-fetched supposition that he must have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Down here?\" Morriston objected incredulously. \"Where he was a stranger?\n",
      "Unless some ingenious person, bent on vengeance, tracked him here and\n",
      "then lured him into the tower. Then how did the determined pursuer\n",
      "contrive to leave him and the key inside the locked room?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At Wynford Place, where they had now arrived, they found several callers.\n",
      "The subject of the tragedy was naturally uppermost in everybody's mind,\n",
      "and the principal topic of conversation. Morriston and his companions\n",
      "were eagerly questioned as to what had come out at the inquest, but,\n",
      "except that the medical evidence was rather sceptical of the suicide\n",
      "theory, were unable to relieve the curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, my dear Dick,\" remarked Lord Painswick, who was there, \"we can\n",
      "furnish more evidence in this room than you seem to have got hold of at\n",
      "the inquest.\" And he looked round the company with a knowing smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean, Painswick?\" Morriston asked eagerly. \"Has anything\n",
      "more come to light?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only we have had a lady here, Miss Elyot, who says she danced with the\n",
      "poor fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only just took a turn with him, for the waltz was nearly over when he\n",
      "asked me,\" said the girl thus alluded to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you wear a green dress?\" Kelson asked eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only that it must have been you I saw with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And can you throw any light on the mystery?\" Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl shook her head. \"None at all, I'm afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did Mr. Henshaw's manner or state of mind strike you as being peculiar?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least,\" Miss Elyot answered with decision. \"During the short\n",
      "time we were together our talk was quite commonplace, mostly of the\n",
      "changes in the county.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he, Henshaw, know it formerly?\" Morriston asked with some surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" Miss Elyot answered, \"he used to stay with some people over\n",
      "at Lamberton; you remember the Peltons, Muriel?\" she turned to Miss\n",
      "Tredworth. \"Of course you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" Muriel Tredworth answered. \"I remember them quite well,\n",
      "although we didn't know much about them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you recollect,\" Miss Elyot continued, \"meeting this very Mr.\n",
      "Henshaw at a big garden party they gave. I know you played tennis\n",
      "with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did I?\" Miss Tredworth replied. \"What a memory you have, Gladys. You\n",
      "can't expect me to recollect every one of the scores of men I must have\n",
      "played tennis with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke she caught Gifford's eye; he was watching her keenly, more\n",
      "closely perhaps than manners or tact warranted. \"And do you find the\n",
      "place much changed since your time, Mr. Gifford?\" she inquired, as though\n",
      "to relieve the awkwardness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not as much as I could have imagined,\" he answered, through what seemed\n",
      "a fit of preoccupation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Gifford has not had much opportunity yet of seeing how far it has\n",
      "altered, with this tragic affair to upset everything,\" Morriston put in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it has been a most unlucky time for him to revisit Wynford,\" Miss\n",
      "Morriston added in her cold tone. \"I hope Mr. Gifford is not going to\n",
      "hurry away from the neighbourhood in consequence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if I can prevent it,\" Kelson replied, with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope,\" Morriston said hospitably, \"that whether his stay be short or\n",
      "long Mr. Gifford will consider himself quite at home here. And I need not\n",
      "say, my dear Kelson, that invitation includes you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men thanked him. \"We have already done a little trespassing in your\n",
      "park,\" Kelson observed with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't call it trespassing again,\" Miss Morriston commanded. \"Let\n",
      "me give you another cup of tea, Muriel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The old house looks most picturesque by moon-light,\" observed Lord\n",
      "Painswick. \"I was quite fascinated by it the other night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is a full moon now,\" Gifford said. \"We will stroll round and\n",
      "admire when we leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't stroll over the edge of the haha as I very nearly did one night,\"\n",
      "Morriston said laughingly. \"When it lies in the shadow of the house it is\n",
      "a regular trap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Moonlight has its dangers as well as its beauties,\" Painswick murmured\n",
      "sententiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The friendly cloak of night is apt to trip one up,\" Gifford added.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke the words there came a startling little cry from Miss\n",
      "Tredworth accompanied by the crash and clatter of falling crockery.\n",
      "Gifford's remark had been made with his eyes fixed on his friend's\n",
      "_fiancée_, to whom at that moment Miss Morriston was handing the refilled\n",
      "cup of tea. A hand of each girl was upon the saucer as the words were\n",
      "uttered; by whose fault it was let fall it was impossible to say. But the\n",
      "slight cry of dismay had come from Miss Tredworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I am so sorry,\" she exclaimed, colouring with vexation. \"How stupid\n",
      "and clumsy of me. Your lovely china.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was my fault,\" Edith Morriston protested, her clear-cut face showing\n",
      "no trace of annoyance. \"I thought you had hold of the cup, and I let it\n",
      "go too soon. Ring the bell, will you, Dick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't distress yourself, Miss Tredworth,\" Mr. Morriston entreated\n",
      "her as he crossed to the bell. \"I'm sure it was not your fault.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was that a quotation, Mr. Gifford?\" Miss Morriston asked, clearly with\n",
      "the object of dismissing the unfortunate episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My remark about the cloak of night?\" he replied. \"Perhaps. I seem to\n",
      "have heard something like it somewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he spoke he glanced curiously at Miss Tredworth.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next evening the two friends at the _Golden Lion_ were engaged to dine\n",
      "with the Morristons. They had been out with the hounds all day, and,\n",
      "beyond the natural gossip of the country-side, had heard nothing fresh\n",
      "concerning the tragedy. Gervase Henshaw had gone up to town for his\n",
      "brother's funeral, and Host Dipper had no fresh development to report. In\n",
      "answer to a question from Gifford, he said he expected Mr. Henshaw back\n",
      "on the morrow, or at latest the day after.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is altogether a most mysterious affair,\" he observed sagely, being\n",
      "free, now that his late guest's perplexing disappearance was accounted\n",
      "for, even in that tragic fashion, to regard the business and to moralize\n",
      "over it without much personal feeling in the matter. \"I fancy Mr. Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw means to work the police up to getting to the bottom of it. For\n",
      "I don't fancy that he is by any means satisfied that his unfortunate\n",
      "brother took his own life. And I must say,\" he added in a pronouncement\n",
      "evidently the fruit of careful deliberation, \"I don't know how it strikes\n",
      "you, gentlemen, but from what I saw of the deceased it is hard to imagine\n",
      "him as making away with himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford replied. \"But before any other conclusion can be fairly\n",
      "arrived at the police will have to account for the locked door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently Mr. Dipper's lucubrations had not, so far, reached a\n",
      "satisfactory explanation of that puzzle; he could only wag his head and\n",
      "respond generally, \"Ah, yes. That will be a hard nut for them to crack,\n",
      "I'm thinking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner at Wynford Place was made as cheerful as, with the gloom of a\n",
      "tragedy over the house, could be possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had the police with a couple of detectives here all this morning,\"\n",
      "Morriston said, \"and a great upset it has been. After having made the\n",
      "most minute scrutiny of the room in the tower they had every one of the\n",
      "servants in one by one and put them through a most searching examination.\n",
      "But, I imagine, without result. No one in the house, and I have\n",
      "questioned most of them casually myself, seems to be able to throw the\n",
      "smallest light on the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have the police arrived at any theory?\" Gifford inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Apparently they have come to no definite conclusion,\" Morriston\n",
      "answered. \"They seemed to have an idea, though--to account for the\n",
      "problem of the locked door--that thieves might have got into the house\n",
      "with the object of making a haul in the bedrooms while every one's\n",
      "attention was engaged down below, have secreted themselves in the tower,\n",
      "been surprised by Henshaw, and, to save themselves, have taken the only\n",
      "effectual means of silencing him, poor fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then how, with the door locked on the inside did they make their\n",
      "escape?\" Miss Morriston asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That can so far be only a matter of conjecture,\" her brother answered,\n",
      "with a shrug. \"Of course they might have provided themselves with some\n",
      "sort of ladder, but there are no signs of it. And the height of the\n",
      "window in that top room is decidedly against the theory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hear at the _Lion_\" Kelson remarked, \"that the brother, Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw, is returning to-morrow or next day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston did not receive the news with any appearance of satisfaction.\n",
      "\"I hope he won't come fussing about here,\" he said, with a touch of\n",
      "protest. \"Making every allowance for the sudden shock under which he was\n",
      "labouring I thought his attitude the other day most objectionable,\n",
      "didn't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did most certainly,\" Gifford answered promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His manners struck me as deplorable,\" Kelson agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" their host continued. \"It never seemed to occur to the fellow that\n",
      "some little sympathy was due also to us. But he seemed rather to suggest\n",
      "that the tragedy was our fault. In ordinary circumstances I should have\n",
      "dealt pretty shortly with him. But it was not worth while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Kelson observed, \"All the same, you need not allow a continuation\n",
      "of his behaviour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to,\" Morriston replied with decision. \"I hope the man\n",
      "won't want to come ferreting in the place; that may well be left to the\n",
      "police; but if he does I can't very well refuse him leave. He must be\n",
      "free of the house, or at any rate of the tower.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or,\" put in Kelson, \"he'll have a grievance against you, and accuse you\n",
      "of trying to burk the mystery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he a very objectionable person?\" Miss Morriston asked. \"We passed one\n",
      "another in the hall as he left the house and I received what seemed a\n",
      "rather unmannerly stare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother laughed. \"My dear Edith, the type of man you would simply\n",
      "loathe. Abnormally, unpleasantly sharp and suspicious; with a cleverness\n",
      "which takes no account of tact or politeness, he questions you as though\n",
      "you were in the witness-box and he a criminal barrister trying to trap\n",
      "you. I don't know whether he behaves more civilly to ladies, but from our\n",
      "experience of the man I should recommend you to keep out of his way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall,\" his sister replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should say no respecter of persons--or anything else,\" Kelson remarked\n",
      "with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us hope he won't take it into his head to worry us,\" Miss Morriston\n",
      "said with quiet indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to see,\" Morriston observed later on when the ladies had\n",
      "left them, \"that the papers are beginning to take a sensational view of\n",
      "the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Kelson responded; \"we noticed that. It will be a nuisance for\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The trouble has already begun,\" his host continued somewhat ruefully.\n",
      "\"We have had two or three reporters here to-day worrying the servants\n",
      "with all sorts of absurd questions. It is, of course, all to be accounted\n",
      "for by the medical evidence. That has put them on the scent of what they\n",
      "will no doubt call a sensational development. So long as it looked like\n",
      "nothing beyond suicide there was not so much likelihood of public\n",
      "interest in the case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The police--\" Gifford began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The police,\" Morriston took up the word, \"are fairly nonplussed. It\n",
      "seems the farther they get the less obvious does the suicide theory\n",
      "become. Well, we shall see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the meantime I'm afraid you and Miss Morriston are in for a heap of\n",
      "undeserved annoyance,\" Kelson observed sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Morriston agreed gloomily; \"I am sorry for Edith; she is plucky,\n",
      "and feels it, I expect, far more than she cares to show.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the men went into the drawing-room Muriel Tredworth made a sign to\n",
      "Kelson; he joined her and, sitting down some distance apart from the\n",
      "rest, they carried on in low tones what seemed to be a serious\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to tell you of something extraordinary which has happened to me,\n",
      "Hugh.\" Gifford just caught the words as the girl led the way out of\n",
      "earshot. He had noticed that she had been rather preoccupied during\n",
      "dinner, an unusual mood for so lively a girl, and now he could not help\n",
      "watching the pair in the distance, she talking with an earnest, troubled\n",
      "expression, and he listening to her story in grave wonderment, now and\n",
      "again interposing a few words. Once they looked at Gifford, and he was\n",
      "certain they were speaking of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the gloom of a tragedy over the house the little party could not be\n",
      "very festive; avoid it as they set themselves to do, the brooding subject\n",
      "could not be ignored, general conversation flagged, and it soon became\n",
      "time for the visitors to say good-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked back to the town together Gifford noticed that his\n",
      "companion was unusually silent, and he tactfully forbore to break in upon\n",
      "his preoccupation. At length Kelson spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Muriel has just been telling me of an unpleasant and unaccountable\n",
      "thing which happened to her this evening. A discovery of a rather\n",
      "alarming character. I said I would take your advice about it, Hugh, and\n",
      "she agreed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does it concern the affair at Wynford?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may,\" Kelson answered in a perplexed tone; \"and yet I don't well see\n",
      "how it can. Anyhow it is uncommonly mysterious. We won't talk about it\n",
      "here,\" he added gravely, \"but wait till we get in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Morriston looked well to-night,\" Gifford remarked, falling in with\n",
      "his friend's wish to postpone the more engrossing subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Kelson agreed casually. \"She takes this ghastly business quietly\n",
      "enough. But that is her way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been wondering,\" Gifford said, \"how much she cares for\n",
      "Painswick. He is manifestly quite smitten, but I doubt her being nearly\n",
      "as keen on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson laughed. \"If you ask me I don't think she cares a bit for him. And\n",
      "one can scarcely be surprised. He is not a bad fellow, but rather a prig,\n",
      "and Edith Morriston is not exactly the sort of girl to suffer that type\n",
      "of man gladly. But her brother is all for the match; from Painswick's\n",
      "point of view she is just the wife for him, money and a statuesque style\n",
      "of beauty; altogether I shall be surprised if it does not come off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are not engaged, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not. They say he proposes regularly once a week. But she\n",
      "holds him off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at the _Golden Lion_ they went straight up to Kelson's room,\n",
      "where with more curiosity than he quite cared to show, Gifford settled\n",
      "himself to hear what the other had to tell him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you noticed how worried Muriel looked all dinner-time,\"\n",
      "Kelson began. \"I thought that what had happened in the house had got on\n",
      "her nerves; but it was something worse than that; I mean touching her\n",
      "more nearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" Gifford said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know,\" Kelson proceeded, \"they are going to this dance at Hasborough\n",
      "to-morrow. Well, it appears that when her maid was overhauling her\n",
      "ball-dress, the same she wore here the other night, she found blood\n",
      "stains on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" Gifford remarked coolly, \"may satisfactorily account for the\n",
      "marks on your cuff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson stared in surprise at the other's coolness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say it does,\" he exclaimed with a touch of impatience. \"I had\n",
      "hardly connected the two. But what do you think of this? How in the name\n",
      "of all that's mysterious can it be accounted for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hardly by the idea that Miss Tredworth had anything to do with the late\n",
      "tragedy,\" was the quiet answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens, man, I should hope not,\" Kelson cried vehemently. \"That\n",
      "is too monstrously absurd.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is Miss Tredworth's idea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has none. She is completely mystified. And inclined to be horribly\n",
      "frightened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally,\" Gifford commented in the same even tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manner seemed to irritate Kelson. \"I wish, my dear Hugh, I could take\n",
      "it half as coolly as you do,\" he exclaimed resentfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what you want me to do or say, Harry,\" Gifford\n",
      "expostulated. \"The whole affair is so utterly mysterious that I can't\n",
      "pretend even to hazard an explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the meantime Muriel and I are in the most appalling position. Why,\n",
      "man, she may at any moment be arrested on suspicion if this discovery\n",
      "leaks out, as it is sure to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't try to hush it up; that would be a fatal mistake,\" Gifford\n",
      "said thoughtfully, \"and would immediately arouse suspicion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally I am not going to be such a fool as to advise that,\" Kelson\n",
      "returned. \"The discovery will be the subject of the servants' talk till\n",
      "it gets all over the place and into the papers. No, what I have\n",
      "determined to do, unless you see any good reason for the contrary, is to\n",
      "go first thing in the morning to the police and tell them. What do you\n",
      "say?\" he added sharply, as Gifford was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not do anything in a hurry,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But surely,\" Kelson remonstrated, \"the sooner we take the line of\n",
      "putting ourselves in the right the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Gifford paused before replying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can Miss Tredworth give no explanation, has she no idea as to how the\n",
      "stains came on her dress?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None whatever,\" was the emphatic answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are absolutely sure of that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson jumped up from his chair. \"Hugh, what are you driving at?\" he\n",
      "cried, his eyes full of vague suspicion. \"I--I don't understand the cool\n",
      "way you are taking this. There is something behind it. Tell me. I will\n",
      "know; I have a right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently the man was almost beside himself with the fear of something he\n",
      "could not comprehend. Gifford rose and laid a hand sympathetically on\n",
      "his shoulder. \"I am sorry to seem so brutal, Harry,\" he said gently, \"but\n",
      "this discovery does not surprise me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson recoiled as from a blow, staring at his friend with a\n",
      "horror-struck face. \"Why, good heavens, what do you mean?\" he gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only,\" Gifford answered calmly, \"that when you introduced me to\n",
      "Miss Tredworth at the dance I noticed the stains on the white\n",
      "flowers she wore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did?\" Kelson was staring stupidly at Gifford. \"And you knew they\n",
      "were blood-stains?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not tell that,\" was the answer. \"But now it is pretty certain\n",
      "they were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For some seconds neither man spoke. Then with an effort Kelson seemed to\n",
      "nerve himself to put another question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hugh,\" he said, his eyes pitiful with fear, \"you--you don't think Muriel\n",
      "Tredworth had anything to do with Henshaw's death?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford turned away, and leaned on the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what to think,\" he said gloomily.\n",

      "GIFFORD'S COMMISSION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning directly after breakfast Kelson started for Wynford Place.\n",
      "As the result of deliberating fully upon the anxious problem before them,\n",
      "he and Gifford had come to the conclusion that it might be a grave\n",
      "mistake to try to keep secret the maid's discovery. It would doubtless by\n",
      "this time have become a subject of gossip and speculation in the\n",
      "household and consequently would very soon become public. Accordingly it\n",
      "was arranged that Kelson should arrive first and have a private interview\n",
      "with Muriel Tredworth with a view to ascertaining finally and for certain\n",
      "whether she could in any way account for the stain on her dress. Gifford\n",
      "was to follow half an hour later, when they would have a conference with\n",
      "the Morristons and afterwards, with their approval, go into the town and\n",
      "see the chief constable on the subject. If Gifford was doubtful as to\n",
      "the expediency of the plan, and it was with a considerable amount of\n",
      "hesitation that he brought himself to agree to it, he seemed to have no\n",
      "good reason to urge against it. And, after all, it appeared, in the\n",
      "circumstances, the only politic course to follow. Secrecy was practically\n",
      "now out of the question, and any attempt in that direction would\n",
      "inevitably fail and would in all probability produce results unpleasant\n",
      "to contemplate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Gifford arrived at Wynford Place he found Kelson pacing the drive\n",
      "and impatiently expecting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along,\" he exclaimed, \"the Morristons are waiting for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Tredworth--?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is utterly unable to account for the state of her dress,\" Kelson\n",
      "declared promptly. \"She is positive that if she noticed the man she never\n",
      "spoke a word to him, nor danced with him. She says that if she ever met\n",
      "him before, as according to that girl the other day was the case, she had\n",
      "quite forgotten the circumstance. So the sooner we communicate this\n",
      "discovery to the police the better. As it is, they say the servants are\n",
      "talking of it; so the present position is quite intolerable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the library they found Morriston and his sister with the Tredworths.\n",
      "The situation was discussed and there seemed no doubt in the mind of\n",
      "any one of the party that the only thing to be done was to inform the\n",
      "police at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole affair is so mysterious,\" Morriston said, \"that all sorts of\n",
      "absurd rumours will be afloat if we don't take a strong, straightforward\n",
      "line at once. Don't you agree, Edith?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly I do,\" Miss Morriston answered with decision. \"I don't\n",
      "suppose,\" she added with a smile, \"that any one would be mad enough to\n",
      "suggest, my dear Muriel, that you were in any way implicated in the\n",
      "affair; but the world is full of stupid and ill-natured people and one\n",
      "can't be too careful to put oneself in the right. Don't you agree,\n",
      "Captain Kelson?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most decidedly,\" Kelson replied, with a troubled face. Charlie Tredworth\n",
      "was also quite emphatically of opinion that his sister should make no\n",
      "secret of what had been found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The inspector, who is here,\" Morriston said, \"tells me that Major\n",
      "Freeman, our chief constable, intends to come here this morning. I'll say\n",
      "we want to see him directly he arrives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before the chief constable was shown into the library.\n",
      "Morriston lost no time in telling him of the mysterious circumstance\n",
      "which had come to light. Major Freeman, a keen soldierly man, with the\n",
      "stern expression and uncompromising manner naturally acquired by those\n",
      "whose business is to deal with crime, received the information with grave\n",
      "perplexity. He turned a searching look upon Muriel Tredworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you are quite unable to account for the stains on your\n",
      "dress, Miss Tredworth?\" he asked in a tone of courteous insistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite,\" she answered. \"I did not speak to Mr. Henshaw or even notice him\n",
      "in the ball-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had--pardon these questions; I am putting this in your own\n",
      "interest--you had at no time any acquaintance with Mr. Clement Henshaw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can hardly say that I had,\" the girl replied; \"although a friend has\n",
      "told me that I played tennis with him at a garden-party some years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A circumstance which you do not recollect?\" The question was put\n",
      "politely, even sympathetically, yet with a certain uncomfortable\n",
      "directness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Muriel answered. \"Even when I was reminded of it, my recollection\n",
      "was of the vaguest description. So far as that goes I could neither admit\n",
      "nor deny it with any certainty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And naturally you never, to your knowledge, saw or communicated with the\n",
      "deceased man since?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Muriel flushed. \"No; absolutely no,\" she returned with a touch of\n",
      "resentment at the suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Freeman forbore to distress the girl by any further questioning.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" he said simply. \"I am sorry to have even appeared to suggest\n",
      "such a thing, but you and your friends will appreciate that it was my\n",
      "duty to ask these questions. This looks at the moment,\" he continued,\n",
      "addressing himself now to the party in general, \"like proving a very\n",
      "mysterious, and I will add, peculiarly delicate affair. The medical\n",
      "evidence is inclined to scout the idea of suicide, and my men who have\n",
      "the case in hand are coming round to the conclusion that the theory is\n",
      "untenable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The locked door--\" Morriston suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The locked door,\" said Major Freeman, \"presents a difficulty, but still\n",
      "one not absolutely incapable of solution. We know,\" he added, with a\n",
      "faint smile, \"from the way the door was eventually opened, that a key can\n",
      "be turned from the other side, given the right instrument to effect it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which only a burglar or a locksmith would be likely to have,\" Kelson\n",
      "suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Freeman nodded. \"Quite so. I am not for a moment suggesting that as\n",
      "an explanation of the mystery. It goes naturally much deeper than that.\n",
      "Mr. Gervase Henshaw is to look into his brother's affairs and papers\n",
      "while in town, and I am hoping that on his return here he may be able to\n",
      "give some information which will afford a clue on which we can work. In\n",
      "the meantime my men are not relaxing their efforts in this rather\n",
      "baffling case.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In which,\" Morriston suggested, \"this new piece of evidence does not\n",
      "afford any useful clue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Freeman smiled, a little awkwardly, it seemed. \"If anything, it\n",
      "would appear to complicate the problem still further,\" he replied\n",
      "guardedly. \"Still, I am very glad to have it, and thank you for informing\n",
      "me so promptly. Miss Tredworth may rest assured that should we find it\n",
      "necessary to go still farther into this piece of evidence, it will be\n",
      "done with as little annoyance as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the chief constable's habitual sternness of manner seemed to\n",
      "have returned to him as he now rose to take leave. \"I will just confer\n",
      "with my men who are on the premises before I leave,\" he said to\n",
      "Morriston in a quiet authoritative tone. \"They may have something to\n",
      "report.\" With that he bowed to the company and quitted the room, leaving\n",
      "behind him a rather uncomfortable feeling which every one seemed to make\n",
      "an effort to throw off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was clearly nothing to be done except to let the police\n",
      "researches take their course and to wait for developments. The party\n",
      "at Wynford was going over to the dance at Stowgrave that evening and\n",
      "it was arranged that they would call for Kelson and Gifford and all go\n",
      "on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly at the appointed time the carriage stopped at the _Golden\n",
      "Lion_; Kelson joining Miss Tredworth and her brother, while Gifford drove\n",
      "with Morriston.\n",
      "\n",
      "In answer to his companion's inquiry Morriston said that he had heard of\n",
      "nothing fresh in the Henshaw case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw Major Freeman for a moment as he was leaving,\" he said, \"and\n",
      "gathered that the police were still at a loss for any satisfactory\n",
      "explanation as to how the crime was committed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He made no suggestion as to the stains on Miss Tredworth's dress?\"\n",
      "Gifford asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Although I fancy he is a good deal exercised by that piece of\n",
      "evidence. Mentioned, as delicately as possible, that it might be\n",
      "necessary to have the stains analyzed, but did not wish the girl to be\n",
      "alarmed or worried about it. I can't understand,\" Morriston added in a\n",
      "puzzled tone, \"how on earth she could possibly have had anything to\n",
      "do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford assented thoughtfully; \"it is inconceivable, unless by the\n",
      "supposition that she may by some means have come in contact with some one\n",
      "who was concerned in the crime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean if a man had a stain on his coat and danced with her--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something of the sort. If there were blood on his lapel or sleeve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! It would be easy to ascertain for certain whom she danced with,\"\n",
      "Morriston said reflectively. \"But that again is almost unthinkable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And,\" Gifford added, \"it seems to go no way towards elucidating the\n",
      "problem of how Henshaw came to his death. As a matter of fact I should\n",
      "say Miss Tredworth danced and sat out nearly the whole of the evening\n",
      "with Kelson. You know he proposed at the dance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I understood that. Poor Kelson; I am sorry for him, and for them\n",
      "both. It is an ominous beginning of their betrothal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is horrible,\" Gifford observed sympathetically. \"Although one tries\n",
      "to think there is really nothing in it for them to be concerned about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dance was an enjoyable affair, and, at any rate for the time,\n",
      "dispersed the depression which had hung over the party from Wynford.\n",
      "Gifford had engaged Miss Morriston for two waltzes, and after a turn or\n",
      "two in the second his partner said she felt tired and suggested they\n",
      "should sit out the rest of it. Accordingly they strolled off to an\n",
      "adjoining room and made themselves comfortable in a retired corner,\n",
      "Gifford, nothing loath to have a quiet chat with the handsome girl whose\n",
      "self-possessed manner with its suggestion of underlying strength of\n",
      "feeling was beginning to fascinate and intrigue his imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is rather pleasant,\" she said a little wearily, \"to get away from\n",
      "the atmosphere of mystery and police investigation we have been living\n",
      "in at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which I hope and believe will very soon be over,\" Gifford responded\n",
      "cheeringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston glanced at him curiously. \"You believe that?\" she returned\n",
      "almost sharply. \"How can you think so? It seems to me that with little\n",
      "apparent likelihood of clearing up the mystery, the affair may drag on\n",
      "for weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford answered with a reassuring smile. \"Hardly that. If the police\n",
      "can make nothing of it, and they seem to be quite nonplussed, they will\n",
      "have to give up their investigations and fall back on their first theory\n",
      "of suicide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaning back and watching his companion's face in profile as she sat\n",
      "forward, he could see that his suggestion was by no means convincing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could take your view, Mr. Gifford,\" she returned, with the\n",
      "suggestion of a bitter smile. \"I dare say if the authorities were left to\n",
      "themselves they might give up. But you forget a very potent factor in the\n",
      "tiresome business, the brother, Mr. Gervase Henshaw; he will keep them up\n",
      "to the work of investigation, will he not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up to a certain point, and one can scarcely blame him. But even then,\n",
      "the police are not likely to continue working on his theories when they\n",
      "lead to no result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No?\" Miss Morriston replied in an unconvinced tone. \"But he is--\" she\n",
      "turned to him. \"Tell me your candid opinion of this Mr. Gervase Henshaw.\n",
      "Is he very--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Objectionable?\" Gifford supplied as she hesitated. \"Unpleasantly sharp\n",
      "and energetic, I should say. Although it is, perhaps, hardly fair to\n",
      "judge a man labouring under the stress of a brother's tragic death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is determined to get to the explanation of the mystery?\" The tinge of\n",
      "excitement she had exhibited in her former question had now passed away:\n",
      "she now spoke in her habitual cold, even tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says so. Naturally he will do all he can to that end. Of course it\n",
      "would be a satisfaction to know for certain how the tragedy came about:\n",
      "not that it matters much otherwise. But unfortunately he rather poses as\n",
      "an expert in criminology, and that will make for pertinacity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Miss Morriston kept silent. \"It is very unfortunate,\" she\n",
      "murmured at length. \"It will worry poor old Dick horribly. I think he is\n",
      "already beginning to wish he had never seen Wynford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford leaned forward. \"Oh, but, my dear Miss Morriston,\" he said\n",
      "earnestly, \"you and your brother must really not take the matter so\n",
      "seriously. It is all very unpleasant, one must admit, but, after all,\n",
      "except that it happened in your house, I don't see that it affects you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think not,\" Miss Morriston responded mechanically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I think so.\" As he spoke Gifford could not help a slight feeling\n",
      "of wonder that this girl, from whom he would have expected an attitude\n",
      "rather of indifference, should allow herself to be so greatly worried by\n",
      "the affair. For that she was far more troubled than she allowed to appear\n",
      "he was certain. It is her pride, he told himself. A high-bred girl like\n",
      "this would naturally hate the very idea of a sensational scandal under\n",
      "her roof, and all its unpleasant, rather sordid accompaniments. \"I wish,\"\n",
      "he added with a touch of fervour, \"that I could persuade you to dismiss\n",
      "any fear of annoyance from your mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you could,\" she responded dully, with an attempt at a smile.\n",
      "Suddenly she turned to him with more animation in her manner than she had\n",
      "hitherto shown. \"Mr. Gifford, you--I--\" she hesitated as though at a loss\n",
      "how to put what she wished to say; \"I have no right to ask you, who are a\n",
      "comparative stranger, to help us in this--this worry, but if you cared\n",
      "to be of assistance I am sure you could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, of course I will,\" he answered with eager gladness. \"Only let\n",
      "me know what you wish and you may command the very utmost I can do. And\n",
      "please don't think of me as a stranger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith Morriston smiled, and to Gifford it was the most fascinating smile\n",
      "he had ever seen. \"Only let me know how I can serve you,\" he said, his\n",
      "pulses tingling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thinking of my brother,\" she replied, in a tone so friendly that it\n",
      "neutralized the rather damping effect of the words. \"He is worrying over\n",
      "this business more than one who does not know him well would think. I had\n",
      "an idea, Mr. Gifford, that you might help us by, in a way, standing\n",
      "between us, so far as might be possible, and this Mr. Gervase Henshaw. He\n",
      "stays at your hotel, does he not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he is expected there to-morrow morning, if not to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may perhaps,\" the girl proceeded, \"be able--I don't know how, and I\n",
      "have no right to ask it--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, Miss Morriston!\" Gifford pleaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To minimize any annoyance we are likely to suffer through his--his\n",
      "uncomfortable zeal,\" she resumed hesitatingly. \"If not that, you may, if\n",
      "he is friendly with you, have an opportunity of getting to hear something\n",
      "of his plans and ideas, and warning me if he is likely to worry us at\n",
      "Wynford. We don't want the tragedy kept alive indefinitely; it would be\n",
      "intolerable. I am sure you understand how I feel. That is all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may rely on me to the utmost,\" Gifford assured her fervently, in\n",
      "answer to the question in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said, as she rose. \"I felt sure I might ask you this\n",
      "favour and trust you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a slight movement of putting out her hand. The gesture was\n",
      "coldly made; it might, indeed, have been checked, and gone for nothing.\n",
      "But Gifford, keenly on the alert for a sign of regard, was quick to take\n",
      "the hand and press it impulsively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may trust me, Miss Morriston,\" he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" she responded simply, but, he was glad to notice, with a\n",
      "touch of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lightly took his arm and they went back to the ball-room.\n",

      "\n",
      "HAD HENSHAW A CLUE?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Gervase Henshaw made his expected reappearance in Branchester.\n",
      "He left his luggage at the _Golden Lion_ and then went off to the\n",
      "police-station where he had a long interview with the chief constable.\n",
      "Mindful of his promise to Edith Morriston, Hugh Gifford kept about the\n",
      "town with the object of coming across Henshaw and getting to know, if\n",
      "possible, something of his intentions. The attraction he had, even from\n",
      "their first introduction, felt towards Miss Morriston had become quickly\n",
      "intensified by their strangely confidential talk on the previous\n",
      "evening. So far she was to him something of a puzzle, but a puzzle of\n",
      "the most fascinating kind. It was, perhaps, strangely unaccountable that\n",
      "she should have chosen to invoke his help who was little more than a\n",
      "casual acquaintance; still, he argued as he reviewed the situation, she\n",
      "had probably been drawn to him as the one man on the spot who was\n",
      "likely to be of use to them. Her brother, a good, sensible fellow of\n",
      "some character, was nevertheless an ordinary country gentleman, given up\n",
      "to sport of all kinds and naturally quite unversed in the subtleties of\n",
      "life and character which can be studied only by those who live in the\n",
      "more intellectual atmosphere of cities. The same judgment would apply to\n",
      "his friend Kelson, a chivalrous sportsman, who would unselfishly do\n",
      "anything in his power to be of help, but whose ability and penetration\n",
      "by no means matched his willingness. And probably these men were types\n",
      "of the bulk of the Morristons' friends and acquaintances, at any rate of\n",

      "the world in its many aspects would be the best man she could enlist to\n",
      "help her. That her confidence had been drawn by any particular personal\n",
      "liking he never for one moment admitted; that unfortunately was so far\n",
      "all on one side, whatever hopes the future might hold out to him.\n",
      "Anyhow he blessed his luck that an accident had so quickly broken the\n",
      "ice and established a state of confidential relationship between them.\n",
      "As to there being an adequate reason for alarm Gifford was not inclined\n",
      "to question, since he quite realized that this man Henshaw might easily\n",
      "constitute himself a grave annoyance to the Morristons. A clever girl\n",
      "like Edith Morriston, more sensitive than to a casual observer would\n",
      "appear, had naturally recognized this danger and was anxious to have the\n",
      "man, with his, perhaps, none too scrupulous methods, held in check; and\n",
      "to this service Gifford was only too happy to devote himself, glad\n",
      "beyond measure that the opportunity had been given him by the girl who\n",
      "had filled his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until evening that he came across Henshaw, it being to his\n",
      "mind essential not to appear anxious or to seek out the criminologist\n",
      "with the obvious view of getting information as to his plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you are back again, Mr. Henshaw,\" he said with a careless nod of\n",
      "greeting as they encountered in the hall of the hotel. \"I hear the\n",
      "police have not yet arrived at any satisfactory conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw drew back his lips in a slight smile. To Gifford the expression\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There is a likelihood of our not being at a loss much longer,\" Henshaw\n",
      "replied, speaking through his teeth with a certain grim satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, you have made a discovery?\" Gifford exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw's face hardened. \"I am not yet at liberty to say what I have\n",
      "found,\" he returned in an uncompromising tone. \"But I think you may\n",
      "take it from me as absolutely certain that my brother did not take his\n",
      "own life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With pursed lips Gifford nodded acceptance of the statement. \"That makes\n",
      "the affair look serious, not to say sensational,\" he responded. \"I\n",
      "suppose one must not ask you whether you have a clue to the perpetrator.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can hardly say that yet,\" Henshaw answered with a rather cunning\n",
      "look. \"You, as one of our profession, Mr. Gifford, will understand that\n",
      "and the unwisdom of premature statements.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly I do,\" Gifford agreed promptly. \"And am quite content to\n",
      "restrain my curiosity till I get information from the papers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw laughed intriguingly. \"There are certain things that don't find\n",
      "their way into the Press,\" he said meaningly. \"The real story in this\n",
      "case may turn out to be one of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eager as he was, Gifford resolved to show no further curiosity. \"You know\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Naturally. They are getting rather worried by all this police fuss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally.\" Henshaw repeated Gifford's word with a curious emphasis. \"It\n",

      "that the manner of my brother's death should be thoroughly investigated.\"\n",

      "About noon next day Gifford went with Kelson to Wynford Place. They had\n",
      "seen nothing more of Henshaw who, it seemed, was rather inclined to hold\n",
      "away from them, possibly with a view to avoiding an opportunity of\n",
      "discussing the affair, or because he was occupied in following up some\n",
      "clue he had, or thought he had, got hold of. This was naturally a\n",
      "disappointment to Gifford, who was anxious, on Miss Morriston's behalf,\n",
      "to keep himself posted as to Henshaw's intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Kelson, \"the fellow will have heard of the stains found\n",
      "on Muriel's dress, and will set himself to make the most of that\n",
      "discovery. I only hope he won't take to worrying her. She is quite enough\n",
      "upset about it without that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doubtless that is why he is keeping away from us,\" Gifford observed. \"He\n",
      "probably has heard of your engagement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And has the decency to see that he cannot very well discuss the matter\n",
      "with us,\" Kelson added.\n",
      "\n",
      "On their arrival at Wynford Place Morriston told them that Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw was there with a detective in the room of the tragedy. \"There is\n",
      "a decided improvement in his manner to-day,\" he said with a laugh. \"He\n",
      "has been quite considerate and apologetic; so much so that I think I\n",
      "shall have to ask him to stay to luncheon; it seems rather churlish in\n",
      "the circumstances not to do so when the man is actually in the house on\n",
      "what should be to him a very sad business. But you fellows must stay too,\n",
      "to take off some of the strain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They accepted; Gifford not sorry, for more reasons than one, to stay.\n",

      "\n",

      "strolled off down a secluded walk, \"but so far have had a chance of\n",
      "speaking to him only once, when I ran across him in the hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes?\" she responded, with a scarcely concealed curiosity to hear what\n",
      "had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has evidently got hold of some clue, or at least thinks he has,\"\n",
      "Gifford proceeded. \"But what it is he did not tell me. In fact he rather\n",
      "declined to discuss the affair. I fancy he had had a long consultation\n",
      "with the police authorities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he would tell you nothing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing. I rather expected he might have come, as before, to discuss the\n",
      "case with us, but he has made a point of keeping away. I hear, however,\n",
      "from your brother that he seems far less objectionable this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhat to Gifford's surprise, she gave a rather grudging assent. \"Yes,\n",
      "I suppose he is. I happened to see him on his arrival, and he certainly\n",
      "was polite enough, but it is possible to be even objectionably polite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford glanced at her curiously, wondering what had taken place to call\n",
      "forth the remark. \"I know that,\" he said. \"I do hope the man has not\n",
      "annoyed you. From what your brother told us--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" she interrupted, \"I can't say he has annoyed me--from his\n",
      "point of view.\" She laughed. \"The man tried to be particularly\n",
      "agreeable, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And succeeded in being the reverse,\" Gifford added. \"I can quite\n",
      "understand. Still, it might be worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" she agreed in a tone which did nothing to abate his curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The luncheon bell rang out and they turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't thanked you for looking after our interests, Mr. Gifford,\" the\n",
      "girl said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have unfortunately been able to do nothing,\" he replied deprecatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you have tried,\" she rejoined graciously, \"and it is not your fault\n",
      "if you have not succeeded. It is a comfort to think that we have a friend\n",
      "at hand ready to help us if need be, and I am most grateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The unusual feeling in her tone thrilled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should love to do something worthy of your gratitude,\" he responded,\n",
      "in a subdued tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You take a lower view of your service than I do,\" she rejoined as they\n",
      "reached the house, and no more could be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At luncheon the improvement which their host had mentioned in Henshaw's\n",
      "attitude was strikingly apparent. His dogmatic self-assertiveness which\n",
      "had before been found so irritating was laid aside; his manner was\n",
      "subdued, his tone was sympathetic as he apologized for all the annoyance\n",
      "to which his host and hostess were being put. Gifford, watching him\n",
      "alertly, wondered at the change, and more particularly at its cause,\n",
      "which set him speculating. What did it portend? It seemed as though the\n",
      "complete alteration in the man's attitude and manner might indicate that\n",
      "he had got the solution of the mystery, and no longer had that problem to\n",
      "worry him. Certainly there was little to find fault with in him to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing, however, Gifford did not like, and that was Henshaw's rather\n",
      "obvious admiration for Edith Morriston. When they took their places at\n",
      "table, she had motioned to Gifford to sit beside her, and from that\n",
      "position it gradually forced itself upon his notice that Henshaw\n",
      "scarcely took his eyes off his hostess, addressing most of his\n",
      "conversation, and he was a fluent talker, to her. It was, of course,\n",
      "scarcely to be wondered at that this handsome, capable girl should call\n",
      "forth any man's admiration. Gifford himself was indeed beginning to fall\n",
      "desperately in love with her, but this naturally made Henshaw's rather\n",
      "obvious prepossession none the less disagreeable to him. This, then, he\n",
      "reflected, was the explanation of what Miss Morriston had hinted at,\n",
      "what she had described as his objectionable excess of politeness at\n",
      "their meeting that morning. Happily, however, Gifford felt secure in his\n",
      "position as her accredited ally and in her expressed dislike to the man\n",
      "whom it seemed she had unwittingly fascinated. It was indeed unthinkable\n",
      "that this splendid, high-bred girl could ever be responsive to the\n",
      "advances of this unpleasantly sharp, rather underbred man, and he was a\n",
      "little surprised that she could respond to his remarks quite so\n",
      "genially, with more graciousness indeed than even her position as\n",
      "hostess called forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not quite reconcile it with the way she had spoken of him\n",
      "previously; but then he told himself that he was making too much of the\n",
      "business, and saw what was mere politeness through the magnifying glasses\n",
      "of jealousy. And so, secure in his position, he proceeded to view\n",

      "WHAT GIFFORD SAW IN THE WOOD\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next day or two Gifford saw next to nothing of Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw. They had parted amicably enough after luncheon at Wynford Place;\n",
      "indeed, the change in Henshaw's demeanour had been something of a puzzle\n",
      "to the two friends, although Kelson did not seem much exercised by it.\n",
      "\"The fellow has evidently come to the conclusion that in dealing with\n",
      "people like the Morristons an offensive brow-beating manner does not\n",
      "pay,\" he remarked casually. Gifford, however, had an idea that the reason\n",
      "for the change lay somewhat deeper than that. He wondered whether in the\n",
      "absence of any other apparent cause, Edith Morriston's attractiveness had\n",
      "had anything to do with it. It was not a pleasant idea; still, if it\n",
      "saved her annoyance that would be something gained, he thought; and that\n",
      "it should have any farther result was out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not had that day an opportunity of any private talk with Miss\n",
      "Morriston, for she had driven out after luncheon to pay a call. But a\n",
      "certain suggestion of warmth in her leave-taking had assured him that she\n",
      "still looked for his help and that the conditions were not changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "What he had undertaken so eagerly was now, however, not easy of\n",
      "accomplishment. For reasons at which Gifford could only guess, Henshaw\n",
      "seemed to be playing an elusive game; he kept out of sight, or, at any\n",
      "rate, avoided all intercourse with the two friends, and on the rare\n",
      "occasions when they met he was to Gifford tantalizingly uncommunicative.\n",
      "That something was evidently behind his reticence made it all the more\n",
      "unsatisfactory, since the result was that Gifford had no object in going\n",
      "to Wynford Place, for he had nothing to tell. Indeed he learnt more from\n",
      "the Morristons than from Henshaw. The police had concluded their\n",
      "investigations on the premises, much to the relief of the household, who\n",
      "were now left in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They don't seem to have come to any definite conclusion as to how the\n",
      "tragedy happened,\" Morriston said. \"They have an idea, as I gather from\n",
      "Major Freeman, where to look for the murderer, if murder it was; which I\n",
      "am rather inclined to doubt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Henshaw likely to give up the search?\" Gifford asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston looked puzzled. \"I can't make out,\" he answered in a slightly\n",
      "perplexed tone. \"Even Freeman does not seem to know what his idea is. He\n",
      "is still about here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford replied. \"I caught a glimpse of him this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curious,\" Morriston remarked. \"I came across the fellow yesterday\n",
      "afternoon in the big plantation here. He was mooning about and didn't\n",
      "seem best pleased to see me, but he was quite duly apologetic, said he\n",
      "was puzzling over the tragedy and hoped I didn't mind his trespassing on\n",
      "my property. Of course I told him he was free to come and go as he\n",
      "liked, but it did strike me as peculiar that he should be thinking out\n",
      "the case in that plantation which has no possible connexion with the\n",
      "scene of the crime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it was curious,\" Gifford agreed reflectively. \"Did he tell you\n",
      "what he was doing about the business?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston shook his head. \"No; he wasn't communicative; didn't seem to\n",
      "have much to go upon. Of course one can't tell what the fellow has at the\n",
      "back of his mind, but I was rather surprised that a Londoner of his\n",
      "energy and smartness should spend his time loafing about down here with\n",
      "what seems a poor chance of any result; and I nearly told him so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it is as well you didn't,\" Gifford replied. \"He is suspicious\n",
      "enough to imagine you might have a motive in wanting to get rid of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston laughed. \"I have. He is not exactly the man one wants to have\n",
      "prowling about the place; but it would not be polite to hint as much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The episode, trivial as it seemed to Morriston, gave Gifford food for\n",
      "disagreeable reflection. Why, indeed, should Henshaw be hanging about in\n",
      "the grounds of Wynford, and give so unconvincing a reason? What troubled\n",
      "Gifford most was that the man's reticent attitude precluded all hope of\n",
      "his learning anything of his plans which could usefully be imparted to\n",
      "Miss Morriston. Evidently there was nothing to be got out of him; the\n",
      "rather open confidence he had displayed on his first appearance at\n",
      "Branchester had quite disappeared, and if Gifford was to find out\n",
      "anything worth reporting it would assuredly not be due to any\n",
      "communication from the man himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had accordingly to be content with the resolve to keep a wary eye on\n",
      "Henshaw's movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was now pretty free to do this. The Tredworths had ended their visit\n",
      "at Wynford and had returned home, and naturally Kelson spent much of his\n",
      "time over there, leaving Gifford to his own devices. It had, in view of\n",
      "Gifford's commission from Miss Morriston, been arranged that he should\n",
      "share Kelson's rooms at the _Golden Lion_, no longer as a guest, so that\n",
      "both men were now independent of each other. The date of Kelson's wedding\n",
      "seemed now likely to be put off for some months, as his friend had\n",
      "suggested. The unpleasant episode of the stains on Muriel Tredworth's\n",
      "dress had, although there was no indication of attaching serious\n",
      "importance to them, nevertheless cast an uncomfortable shadow over the\n",
      "happiness of her betrothal, and without giving any specific reason she\n",
      "had declared for a postponement of the wedding, for which there was,\n",
      "after all, a quite natural reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it is just as well,\" Kelson remarked to his friend. \"Although it\n",
      "is absolutely unthinkable that Muriel could have had anything to do with\n",
      "the affair, yet one can quite appreciate her wish to wait till perhaps\n",
      "something crops up to give us the explanation beyond all question. It is\n",
      "rather a blow to me, and I hope if the mysterious Mr. Gervase Henshaw is\n",
      "really on the track of the crime he will produce his solution without\n",
      "much more delay. For a girl like Muriel to have even the faintest\n",
      "suspicion hanging over her is simply hateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the mysterious Mr. Henshaw seemed in no hurry to make known his\n",
      "theory, if he had one. Yet he still remained in Branchester, writing all\n",
      "the morning and going out in the afternoon, usually with a handful of\n",
      "letters for post. He always nodded affably to Gifford when they met, but\n",
      "beyond a casual remark on the weather or the events of the day, showed no\n",
      "disposition to chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now while Gifford was in this unsatisfactory state of mind,\n",
      "persevering yet baffled in what he had undertaken to do, a very singular\n",
      "thing came to pass. He strolled out one afternoon, aimlessly, wondering\n",
      "whether the negative result of his efforts justified his remaining in the\n",
      "place, and yet loath to leave it, held there as he was by the attraction\n",
      "of Edith Morriston. He felt he could be making but little way in her\n",
      "favour seeing how he was failing in what he had undertaken to do for her,\n",
      "and as he walked he discussed with himself whether it would not be\n",
      "possible to hit on some more active plan of becoming acquainted with\n",
      "Henshaw's knowledge and intentions. It was obviously a delicate business,\n",
      "and after all, he thought, now that the man's undesirable presence had\n",
      "practically ceased to be an annoyance to the Morristons there scarcely\n",
      "seemed any need to bother about him. On the other hand, however, there\n",

      "Gifford's walk took him over well remembered ground. He was strolling\n",
      "along a path which led through the Wynford property, over a rustic bridge\n",
      "across a stream he had often fished when a boy, and so on into a wood\n",
      "which formed one of the home coverts. Making his way through this\n",
      "familiar haunt of by-gone days he came to one of the long rides which\n",
      "bisected the wood for some quarter of a mile. He turned into this and was\n",
      "just looking out for a comfortable trunk where he might sit and smoke,\n",
      "when he caught sight of two figures in the distance ahead walking slowly\n",
      "just on the fringe of the ride. A man and a woman; their backs were\n",
      "towards him, but his blood gave a leap at the sight as their identity\n",
      "flashed upon him. It was, in its unexpectedness, an almost appalling\n",
      "sight to him, as he realised that the two were none other than Henshaw\n",

      "they turn and put the man's identity beyond uncertainty?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford had not long to wait. Miss Morriston seemed to draw off and began\n",

      "by her side. There was no doubt now as to who he was. Gervase Henshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one glance, now that the face was revealed, proved that, Gifford drew\n",
      "back quickly and hurried deeper into the thick wood fearful lest his\n",
      "footsteps should be heard. When he had gone a safe distance an intense\n",
      "curiosity made him halt and turn. From his place of hiding he could just\n",
      "see the light of the ride along which the couple would pass. He hated\n",
      "the idea of spying upon Edith Morriston; after all, if she chose to walk\n",
      "and talk with this man it was no business of his; but a supreme distrust\n",
      "of Henshaw, unreasonable enough, perhaps, but none the less keen, made\n",
      "him suspicious that the man might be playing some cowardly game, might\n",
      "have drawn the girl to him by unfair means. Otherwise it was surely\n",
      "inconceivable that she should have consented--condescended indeed--to\n",
      "meet him in that clandestine manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Gifford stayed, hesitating between a breach of good form and a\n",
      "legitimate desire to learn whether the girl was being subjected to\n",
      "unfair treatment, the sound of Henshaw's rather penetrating voice came\n",
      "into earshot, and a few seconds later they passed across the line of\n",
      "Gifford's sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could catch but a glimpse of them through the intervening trees as\n",
      "they went by slowly, but it was enough to tell him that Henshaw was\n",
      "talking earnestly, arguing, it seemed, and on Edith Morriston's clear-cut\n",
      "face was a look of trouble which was not good to see. It made Gifford\n",
      "flush with anger to think that this lovely high-bred girl was being\n",
      "worried, probably being made love to, by a man of that objectionable\n",
      "type; for that she could be in that situation without coercion was not to\n",
      "be believed. The reason for Henshaw's prolonged and rather puzzling stay\n",
      "in the place was now accounted for. Moreover, to Gifford's bitter\n",
      "reflection the whole business seemed clear enough. Henshaw had been\n",
      "caught and fascinated by Edith Morriston's beauty, and being, as was\n",
      "obvious, a man of energy and determination, was now in some subtle way\n",
      "making use of the tragedy as a means of forcing his unwelcome attentions\n",
      "on her. How otherwise could this astounding familiarity be arrived at?\n",
      "Sick with disgust and indignation, Gifford turned away and retraced his\n",
      "steps through the wood, dismissing, as likely to lead to a false\n",
      "position, his first impulse to appear on the scene and stop, at any rate\n",
      "for that day, Henshaw's designs. He felt that to act precipitately might\n",
      "do less good than harm. He was, after all, on private ground there, and\n",
      "had no right to intrude upon what in all likelihood Miss Morriston wished\n",
      "to be a secluded interview. What course he would take in the future was\n",
      "another matter, and one which demanded instant and serious consideration.\n",
      "The right line to adopt was indeed a perplexing problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford recalled Morriston's story of having met Henshaw hanging about\n",
      "more or less mysteriously in the plantation, and the annoyance he had\n",
      "expressed at the encounter. The reason was plain enough now. Of course\n",
      "the man was waiting either to waylay Edith Morriston or to meet her by\n",
      "appointment. It was not a pleasant reflection; since the fact showed that\n",
      "these clandestine meetings had probably been going on for some days past.\n",
      "That Henshaw's object was more or less disreputable could not be doubted,\n",
      "and to Gifford the amazing and troubling part of it was that Edith\n",
      "Morriston, the very last woman he would have suspected of consenting to\n",
      "such a course, who had professed an absolute dislike and repugnance to\n",
      "Henshaw, and fear of his annoying presence, should be meeting him thus\n",
      "willingly. Had he not seen them with his own eyes he would have scoffed\n",
      "at the idea as something inconceivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what was he to do? For it was clear that, justified or not as he\n",
      "might be thought in interfering in matters which did not concern him,\n",
      "something must be done. The one obvious course which it seemed he ought\n",
      "to take was to give Richard Morriston a hint of what was on foot, if not\n",
      "a stronger and more explicit statement. For that Morriston could be privy\n",
      "to the correspondence between his sister and Henshaw was quite unlikely.\n",
      "If anything underhand was going on, if Henshaw was holding some threat\n",
      "over the girl or pursuing her with unwelcome attentions her brother, as\n",
      "her natural guardian, should be warned. That seemed to Gifford his\n",
      "manifest duty. And yet he shrank from anything which might seem treachery\n",
      "towards the girl. For, if she needed her brother's help and protection\n",
      "against the man, it would be an easy matter for her to complain of his\n",
      "persecution. Why, he wondered, had she not done so? It was all very\n",
      "mysterious. He tried to imagine how the position had come about. On\n",
      "Henshaw's side it was plain enough. Miss Morriston was not only a\n",
      "strikingly handsome girl, but she was an heiress, possessing, according\n",
      "to Kelson, a considerable fortune in her own right. There, clearly, was\n",
      "Henshaw's motive; an incentive to an unscrupulous man to use every art,\n",
      "fair and unfair, to force himself into her favour. But how had he\n",
      "succeeded so quickly as to make this rather haughty, reserved girl\n",
      "consent to meet in secret the man whom she professed to dislike and\n",
      "avoid? That this unpleasantly sharp, pushing product of the less\n",
      "dignified side of the law could have any personal attraction for one of\n",
      "Edith Morriston's taste and discrimination was impossible. And yet there\n",
      "the challenging fact remained that confidential relations had been\n",
      "established between the disparate pair. Was it possible that this man\n",
      "could have found out something connecting Edith Morriston with his\n",
      "brother's death? The feasibility of the idea came as a shock to Gifford.\n",
      "He stopped dead in his walk as the notion took form in his brain. The\n",
      "possibilities of this most mysterious case were too complicated to be\n",
      "grasped at once. And so with his mind in a whirl of vague conjecture and\n",
      "apprehension he reached his hotel. And there a new development in the\n",

      "discovery of blood-stains has been made at Wynford. On a girl's\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" Kelson answered, \"it appears that Edith Morriston's maid found\n",
      "them some days ago, in fact the day after a similar discovery had been\n",
      "made on Muriel's gown. She had brought the dress which her mistress had\n",
      "worn at the Hunt Ball out of the wardrobe where it hung, in order to fold\n",
      "it away. She appears to have spread it on the bed where the sun shone on\n",
      "it and in the strong light she noticed on the dark material some\n",
      "brownish discolorations. With what had happened about the other dress in\n",
      "her mind, she examined the marks closely, and with such intentness as to\n",
      "raise the curiosity of a housemaid who happened to come into the room. At\n",
      "first Miss Morriston's maid tried to put her off, but the other girl, who\n",
      "was sharp-eyed, had seen the marks, was not to be hood-winked, and the\n",
      "mischief was done. The housemaid seems to be a foolish, babbling\n",
      "creature, and the discovery soon became the talk of the servants' hall,\n",
      "whence it spread till it reached the police.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are they doing about it?\" Gifford asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Morriston says they've had a detective up at the house examining the\n",
      "gown; being so utterly at sea over the affair the police are doubtless\n",
      "glad to catch at anything. There seems little question that the stains\n",
      "are blood, and that makes the whole business still more puzzling. Dick\n",
      "Morriston is naturally very exercised about it, but I am very glad for\n",
      "Muriel's sake that the second discovery has been made. In fact I have\n",
      "been just waiting till I saw you before riding over to tell her of it,\n",
      "and relieve her mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford responded mechanically, \"of course it removes any serious\n",
      "suspicion from Miss Tredworth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And,\" said Kelson eagerly, \"it divides the odium, if there is any. In\n",
      "fact, to my mind, it reduces the whole suspicion to an absurdity. For\n",
      "that both girls could have been concerned in Henshaw's death is\n",
      "absolutely incredible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Gifford agreed thoughtfully; \"they could not both have had a\n",
      "hand in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or either, for that matter,\" Kelson returned with a laugh. \"Don't you\n",
      "admit that the idea is in the highest degree ridiculous?\" he added more\n",
      "sharply as Gifford remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is--inconceivable,\" he admitted abstractedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelson, who had taken up his hat and crop and was turning to the door,\n",
      "wheeled round quickly. \"My dear Hugh,\" he exclaimed impatiently, \"what is\n",
      "the matter with you? What monstrous idea have you got in your head? You\n",
      "owe it to me, and I really must ask you, to speak out plainly. It seems\n",
      "almost an insult to Muriel to ask the question, but do you still persist\n",
      "in the notion that she had, even in the most innocent way, anything to do\n",
      "with Henshaw's death? Because I have her positive assurance that she\n",

      "\n",

      "stabbed to death in practically the next room, the blood-stains on Miss\n",
      "Tredworth's dress were bound to give rise to conjecture. One would\n",

      "suspicion as well as from the horrible shock of the discovery. Still,\n",
      "this new development, though it acquits her, does nothing towards solving\n",
      "the mystery. I wonder whether Edith Morriston has any idea as to how her\n",

      "\n",
      "It was rather a relief to Gifford to be left alone that he might review\n",
      "the situation without interruption. His first thought had been, could\n",
      "this last discovery be accountable for what he had seen that afternoon?\n",
      "Doubtless, after the information reached the police it would not be long\n",
      "in being conveyed to Henshaw. And he was now making use of it to put the\n",
      "screw on, using the hold he had gained over Edith Morriston to bend her\n",
      "to his will. What was that? Marriage? To Gifford the thought was\n",
      "monstrous; yet if it should be that Henshaw had information which put\n",
      "the girl in his power, what could she do? That she had consented to meet\n",
      "him secretly and listen to him went to show that she felt her position to\n",
      "be weak. If so she might need help, an adviser, a man to stand between\n",
      "her and her persecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking out the situation strenuously Gifford determined to seek a\n",
      "private interview with Edith Morriston and offer himself as her\n",
      "protector. At the worst she could but snub him, and the chances were, he\n",
      "thought, greatly in favour of her accepting his offer of help. For from\n",
      "her character he judged she was not a girl to make a stronger appeal to\n",
      "him than the casual invoking of his assistance which had already taken\n",
      "place. He had a very cogent reason for believing that he could be of\n",
      "assistance, although there were certain elements in the mystery which\n",
      "might, in his ignorance of them, upset his calculations.\n",

      "Tredworths in high spirits, the news he carried there having lifted a\n",
      "weight off his fiancée's mind and indeed restored the happiness of the\n",

      "\n",
      "If Kelson might, in ordinary circumstances, have wondered at the motive\n",

      "happy a state of preoccupation to trouble his head about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm your man,\" he responded promptly. \"It so happens that Muriel is\n",

      "Nevertheless he determined to go and do his best to get a private talk\n",
      "with Edith Morriston, however disinclined she might be to grant it. The\n",
      "two men went up to Wynford early in the afternoon, but it was a long time\n",
      "before Gifford got the opportunity he sought. Edith Morriston seemed as\n",
      "friendly and gracious as ever, but whether by accident or design she gave\n",
      "no chance for Gifford to get in a private word. With the knowledge of\n",
      "what he had seen on the previous afternoon and of the change in her\n",
      "attitude he was too shrewd to show any anxiety for a confidential talk.\n",
      "He watched her closely when he could do so unobserved, but her face gave\n",
      "no sign of trouble or embarrassment. He wondered if there could after all\n",
      "be anything in his idea of persecution, and the more curious he became\n",
      "the more determined he grew to find out. But somehow Miss Morriston\n",
      "contrived that they should never be alone together; when Kelson and\n",
      "Muriel Tredworth strolled off lover-like, Miss Morriston kept her brother\n",
      "with her to make a third.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three went round to the stables and inspected the hunters, then\n",
      "through the shrubbery to admire a wonderful bed of snowdrops. As they\n",
      "stood there looking over the undulating park, and Gifford, curbing his\n",
      "impatience, was talking of certain changes which had taken place since\n",
      "his early days there, the butler was seen hurrying towards them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Callers, I suppose,\" Morriston observed with a half-yawn. \"What is\n",
      "it, Stent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could I speak to you, sir?\" the man said, stopping short a little\n",
      "distance away.\n",

      "Morriston went forward to him, and after they had spoken together he\n",
      "turned round, and with an \"Excuse me for a few minutes,\" went off towards\n",
      "the house with the butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at last the opportunity had come. Gifford glanced at his companion and\n",
      "noticed that her face had gone a shade paler than before the\n",
      "interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder what can be the matter,\" she observed, a little anxiously\n",

      "lately have not diminished the tendency.\"\n",

      "with Muriel Tredworth the suspicion of knowing all about the tragedy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hardly that,\" Gifford replied with a smile. \"There can be no cause for\n",
      "that fear. By the way,\" he added more seriously, \"I owe you an account of\n",
      "my failure to gain any information for you with regard to Mr. Gervase\n",
      "Henshaw's plans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is not communicative?\" Miss Morriston suggested casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shook his head. \"No, I am never able to get hold of him. In fact,\n",
      "it seems as though he rather makes a point of avoiding us. And if we do\n",
      "meet, he is vagueness and reticence personified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were walking slowly back along the shrubbery path. The girl turned\n",
      "to him for an instant, her expression softened in a look of gratitude.\n",
      "\"It is very kind of you, Mr. Gifford, to take all this trouble for us.\n",
      "And I am sure it is not your fault that the result is not what you might\n",
      "wish. It was rather absurd of me to set you the task. But I am none the\n",
      "less grateful. Please think that, and do not bother about it any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if the man is likely to annoy you,\" he urged. \"Have you longer any\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We thought he might be unscrupulous and might make himself\n",
      "objectionable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She shrugged. \"I dare say it is possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must confess,\" he pursued, \"I can't quite make the fellow out. Nor his\n",
      "motive for remaining in the place. Your brother told me he came across\n",
      "him hanging about in one of your plantations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought the blood left her face for an instant, but otherwise she\n",
      "showed no sign of discomposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did he account for his being there?\" she asked calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unsatisfactorily enough. I forget his actual excuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was that all?\" she demanded coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe so. But it is hardly desirable, as your brother said, to have\n",
      "the man prowling about the property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment she was silent. \"No,\" she said as though by an afterthought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her manner troubled him. \"I hope he is not attempting to annoy you,\" he\n",
      "said searchingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked surprised and, he thought, a little resentful at his question.\n",
      "\"Me?\" she returned coldly. \"By hanging about in the plantation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he goes no farther than that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should he?\" she demanded in the same rather chilling tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" Gifford replied, set back by her manner. \"Except that I\n",
      "have no high opinion of the fellow. It occurred to me he might possibly\n",
      "attempt to persecute you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced round at him curiously with a little disdainful smile. \"What\n",
      "makes you think he would do that?\" she returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her attitude was to him not convincing. He felt there was a certain\n",
      "reservation beneath the rather cutting tone. \"I am glad to know there is\n",
      "no question of that,\" he replied with quiet earnestness. \"I hope if\n",
      "anything of the kind should occur and you should need a friend you will\n",
      "not overlook me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind,\" she responded, but without turning towards him. He\n",
      "thought, however, that her low tone had softened, and it gave him hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should scarcely take upon myself to suggest this,\" he said, \"but I am\n",
      "emboldened by two facts. One that you have already asked me to be your\n",
      "ally, your friend, in this business, the other that there is something\n",
      "about Henshaw and his actions which I do not understand. I hope you will\n",
      "forgive my boldness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His companion had glanced round now, keenly, as though to probe for the\n",
      "meaning which might lie beneath his words. He speculated whether she\n",
      "might be wondering how much he knew; was he cognisant of her meeting\n",
      "with Henshaw?\n",
      "\n",
      "But, whatever her thought, she answered in the same even voice, \"There is\n",
      "nothing to forgive. On the contrary I am most grateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were nearing the house, and Gifford was debating whether he dared\n",
      "suggest another turn along the shrubbery path, when Richard Morriston\n",
      "appeared at the hall door, beckoned to them, and went in again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder what Dick wants. Has anything more come to light?\" Miss\n",
      "Morriston observed with a rather bored laugh as she slightly\n",
      "quickened her pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went in she called, \"Dick!\" and he answered her from the library.\n",
      "There they found him with Kelson and Muriel Tredworth. A glance at their\n",
      "faces told Gifford that they were all in a state of scarcely suppressed\n",
      "excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I say, Edith, what do you think?\" her brother exclaimed. \"We've made a\n",
      "rather important discovery. Were you in the middle room of the tower\n",
      "during the dance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment his sister did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I don't think I was,\" she said, with what seemed to Gifford a\n",
      "certain amount of apprehension in her eyes, although her expression was\n",
      "calm enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but, my dear girl, you must have been,\" Morriston insisted\n",
      "vehemently. \"We have found the explanation of the stains on Miss\n",
      "Tredworth's dress and on yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have?\" his sister replied, looking at him curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; beyond all doubt. The mystery is made clear. Come and see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He led the way across the hall and up the first story of the tower.\n",
      "\"There's the explanation,\" he said, pointing to some dark red patches on\n",
      "the back of a sofa and on the carpet below.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not a pleasant idea,\" Morriston said; \"but you see these marks are\n",
      "directly under the place where the dead man lay in the room above. The\n",
      "blood from his wound evidently ran through the chinks of the flooring on\n",
      "to the beams of the ceiling here and so fell drop by drop on the couch\n",
      "and on any one sitting there. Rather gruesome, but I am sure we must be\n",
      "all very glad to get the simple explanation. The only wonder is that no\n",
      "one thought of it before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Muriel was sitting just at that end of the sofa when I proposed to her,\"\n",
      "Kelson said in a low voice to Gifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am delighted the matter is so completely accounted for,\" his friend\n",
      "returned. \"What fools we were ever to have taken it so tragically.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But his expression changed as he glanced at Edith Morriston; she had\n",
      "denied that she had been in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have sent down to the police to tell them of the discovery,\" Morriston\n",
      "was saying. \"The fact is that since the tragedy the servants appear to\n",
      "have rather shunned this part of the house, or at any rate to have\n",
      "devoted as little time to it as possible. Otherwise this would have come\n",
      "to light sooner. Anyhow it is a source of congratulation to Miss\n",
      "Tredworth and you, Edith. Of course you must have been in here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember sitting just there; ugh!\" Miss Tredworth said with a shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can swear to that,\" Kelson corroborated with a knowing smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must have done the same or brushed against the sofa, Edith,\"\n",
      "Morriston said cheerfully. \"Well, I'm glad that's settled, although it\n",
      "brings us no nearer towards solving the mystery of what happened\n",
      "overhead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Kelson remarked. \"It looks as though that was going to remain\n",
      "a mystery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The butler came in. \"Major Freeman is here, sir,\" he said, \"with Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "Morriston looked surprised. \"Alfred has been very quick. We sent him off\n",
      "only about a quarter of an hour ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alfred met Major Freeman and Mr. Henshaw with the detective just beyond\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then they were coming up here independently of my message?\"\n",

      "the case. Even Kelson, who was otherwise inclined to be jubilant over\n",
      "the freeing of his fiancée from suspicion, seemed to feel it was no time\n",

      "\n",
      "Gifford was looking, held by the grip of his imagination, at the tall\n",

      "impassiveness. \"I don't see what they can have found out away from this\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It appears a rather extraordinary piece of evidence has just come to\n",
      "light; one which, if true, completely solves the mystery of the locked\n",
      "door. I asked Freeman if there was any objection to you fellows coming\n",
      "to the library and hearing the story; he is quite agreeable. So will you\n",
      "come? You too, Edith, and Miss Tredworth; there is nothing at all\n",
      "horrible in it so far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time Edith Morriston turned from the window. \"Is it\n",
      "necessary, Dick?\" she protested quietly. \"I'd just as soon hear it\n",
      "all afterwards from you. These police visitations are rather getting\n",
      "on my nerves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, dear; you shall hear all about it later on,\" her brother\n",
      "responded, and led the way down to the library. Gifford was the last to\n",
      "leave the room, and his glance back showed him that Edith Morriston had\n",
      "turned again to the window and resumed her former attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the library were the chief constable, Gervase Henshaw and a local\n",
      "detective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Major Freeman,\" Morriston said as he closed the door, \"we shall be\n",
      "glad to hear this new piece of evidence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Major Freeman bowed. \"Shortly, it comes to this,\" he began. \"A young\n",
      "woman named Martha Haynes, belonging to Branchester, called at my office\n",
      "this morning and made a statement which, if reliable, must have an\n",
      "important bearing on this mysterious case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appears from her story that on the night of the Hunt Ball held here\n",
      "she had been paying a visit to some friends at Rapscot, a village, as you\n",
      "know, about a mile beyond Wynford. On her way back to the town, for which\n",
      "she started at about 9.45, she took as a short cut the right-of-way path\n",
      "running across the park and passing near the house. As she went by she\n",
      "was naturally attracted by the lighted windows and could hear the band\n",
      "quite plainly. She stopped to listen to the music at a point which she\n",
      "has indicated, almost directly opposite the tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She says she had stood there for some little time when her attention\n",
      "was suddenly diverted to what seemed a mysterious movement on the\n",
      "outside of the tower. A dark body, presumably a human being, appeared to\n",
      "be slowly sliding down the wall from the topmost window. Unfortunately\n",
      "before she could quite realize what she was looking at--and we may\n",
      "imagine that a country girl would take some little time to grasp so\n",
      "unusual a situation--a cloud drifted across the moon and threw the\n",
      "tower into shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The girl continued, however, to keep her eyes fixed on the spot where\n",
      "she had seen the dark object descending, with the result that in a few\n",
      "seconds she saw it reach and pass over one side of the window of the\n",
      "lower room which was sufficiently lighted up to silhouette anything\n",
      "placed before it. She saw the object move slowly over the window and\n",
      "disappear in the darkness beneath it. When, a few seconds later, the moon\n",
      "came out again nothing more was to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The girl stayed for some time watching the tower, but without result.\n",
      "She is a more or less ignorant, unsophisticated country-woman, and what\n",
      "she had seen she was quite unable to account for. Naturally she hardly\n",
      "connected it with any sort of tragical occurrence. The house with its\n",
      "lights and music seemed given over to gaiety; that any one should just\n",
      "then have met his death in that upper room never entered her imagination.\n",
      "A vague idea that a thief might have got into the house and she had seen\n",
      "him escape by the tower window did indeed, as she says, cross her mind,\n",
      "and that supposition prevented her from approaching the tower to satisfy\n",
      "her curiosity. But as nothing more happened she began to think less of\n",
      "the significance of what she had seen, in fact almost persuaded herself\n",
      "that it had been something of an optical delusion. Presently, having had\n",
      "enough of standing in the cold wind, she resumed her way, went home and\n",
      "to bed, and early next morning left the town to enter a situation in\n",
      "another part of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appears that she had taken cold by her loitering and soon after\n",
      "reaching her destination became so ill that she had to keep her bed, and\n",
      "it was only on her recovery a few days ago that she heard what had\n",
      "happened here that night. Directly she could get away she came over and\n",
      "told her story to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pity she could not have come before,\" Morriston remarked as the chief\n",
      "constable paused. \"Her evidence is highly important, disposing as it does\n",
      "of the mystery of the locked door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Major Freeman agreed, \"and also of the suicide theory. The\n",
      "question now is--who was the person who was seen descending from\n",
      "the window?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could this girl tell whether it was a man or a woman?\" The question came\n",
      "from Henshaw, who had hitherto kept silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She thinks it was a man,\" Major Freeman answered, \"but could not swear\n",
      "to it. The fact of the object being close to the wall made it almost\n",
      "impossible in the imperfect light to distinguish plainly. But I think we\n",
      "may take it that it was a man. The feat could be hardly one a woman would\n",
      "undertake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Gifford agreed. \"And there would seem little chance of identifying\n",
      "the person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None at all so far as the girl Haynes is concerned,\" Major Freeman\n",
      "replied. \"But we have something to go upon; a starting point for a new\n",
      "line of inquiry. The person seen escaping must have lowered himself by\n",
      "a rope from that top window and a considerable length would be\n",
      "required. I have taken the liberty, Mr. Morriston, of setting a party\n",
      "of my men to search the grounds for the rope; they will begin by\n",
      "dragging the little lake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means,\" Morriston assented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Detective Sprules,\" the chief proceeded, \"would like to make another\n",
      "examination of the ironwork of the window. May he go up now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" Morriston answered, and the detective left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford spoke. \"The girl saw nothing of the escaping person after he\n",
      "reached the ground?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, she says,\" Major Freeman answered. \"But the base of the tower\n",
      "was in deep shadow, which would prevent that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pity her curiosity was not a little more practical,\" Henshaw observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\" Gifford turned to him. \"You are proved correct, Mr. Henshaw, in\n",
      "your repudiation of the suicide idea. Perhaps, in view of this latest\n",
      "development, you may have knowledge to go upon of some one from whom your\n",
      "brother might have apprehended danger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw's set face gave indication of nothing but a studied reserve. \"No\n",
      "one certainly,\" he answered coolly, \"from whom he might apprehend danger\n",
      "to his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There must have been a motive for the act,\" Kelson observed. \"Unless it\n",
      "was a sudden quarrel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There appears,\" Major Freeman put in, \"to be no evidence whatever of\n",
      "anything leading up to that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; the cause is so far quite mysterious,\" Henshaw said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Gifford that there was something of undisclosed knowledge\n",
      "behind his words, and he fell to wondering how far the motive was\n",
      "mysterious to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morriston proceeded to acquaint Major Freeman with the discovered cause\n",
      "of the marks on the ladies' dresses, and they all went off to the lower\n",
      "room where the position of the stains was pointed out. Edith Morriston\n",
      "was no longer there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Tredworth sat at this end of the sofa,\" Morriston explained, \"and\n",
      "so the marks on her dress are clearly accounted for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Miss Morriston?\" Henshaw put the question in a tone which had in it,\n",
      "Gifford thought, a touch of scepticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my sister must have been in here too,\" Morriston replied. \"Or how\n",
      "could her dress have been stained? Unless, indeed, she brushed against\n",
      "Miss Tredworth's or someone else's. That's clear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed no alacrity in Henshaw to accept the conclusion and he did\n",
      "not respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad this part of the mystery is so satisfactorily settled,\"\n",
      "the chief constable remarked. \"Now we have the issue narrowed.\n",
      "Well, Sprules?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The detective had appeared at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have examined the ironwork of the window, sir,\" he said, \"and have\n",
      "found under the magnifying-glass traces of the fraying of a rope as\n",
      "though caused by friction against the iron staple.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sufficient signs to bear out the young woman's statement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite, sir. There is upon close examination distinct evidence of a rope\n",
      "having been worked against the hinge of the window.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, Sprules. We may consider that point settled,\" Major\n",
      "Freeman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having finally satisfied themselves as to the cause of the stains on the\n",
      "floor and sofa, the chief constable and his subordinate proposed to go to\n",
      "the lake and see whether the men who were dragging it had had any\n",
      "success. Morriston and Henshaw with Kelson and Gifford accompanied them.\n",
      "As they came in sight of the boat the detective exclaimed, \"They have\n",
      "found it!\" and the men were seen hauling up a rope out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sooner than I expected,\" Major Freeman observed as they hurried towards\n",
      "the nearest point to the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rope when landed proved to be of considerable length, sufficient when\n",
      "doubled, they calculated, to reach from the topmost window to within five\n",
      "or six feet of the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The escaping person,\" Henshaw said, \"must have slid down the doubled\n",
      "rope which had been passed through the staple of the window, and then\n",
      "when the ground was reached have pulled it away, coiled it up, carried it\n",
      "to the lake, and thrown it in. Obviously that was the procedure and it\n",
      "accounts completely for the locked door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief constable and the detective agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man would want some nerve to come down from that height,\" the\n",
      "latter remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any man, or woman either for that matter,\" Henshaw returned\n",
      "dogmatically, \"would not hesitate to take the risk as an alternative to\n",
      "being trapped up there with his victim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not suggesting it might have been a woman who was seen sliding\n",
      "down the rope?\" Gifford asked pointedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw shrugged. \"I suggest nothing as to the person's identity,\" he\n",

      "unlike her usual cold reserve there were signs of a certain suppressed\n",
      "excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope,\" she said, \"that Major Freeman and his people are satisfied with\n",
      "our discovery that the marks on Muriel's dress and mine came there by\n",
      "accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Evidently quite convinced,\" Gifford answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's well,\" she responded with a rather forced laugh. \"It was\n",
      "rather too bad to suspect us, on that evidence, of knowing anything\n",
      "about the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose for a moment they did,\" Gifford assured her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" the girl returned. \"Anyhow it was rather an embarrassing,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Completely,\" he declared. \"You have heard of the new piece of evidence?\"\n",
      "he added casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment she stopped with a start, instantly recovering herself.\n",
      "\"No; what is that?\" in a tone almost of unconcern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford told her of the statement made by the country girl and its\n",
      "corroboration in the finding of the rope. As he continued he felt sure\n",
      "that the story was gripping his companion more and more closely. At last\n",
      "she stopped dead and turned to him with eyes which had in them intense\n",
      "mystification as well as fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Gifford, do you believe that story?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see no reason for disbelieving it,\" he answered quietly. \"It is\n",
      "practically the only conceivable solution of the mystery of the\n",
      "locked door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely--\" she stopped, checking the vehement objection that rose to her\n",
      "lips. \"This girl,\" she went on as though searching for a plausible\n",
      "argument, \"is it not likely that she was mistaken? We know what these\n",
      "country people are. And she could not have seen very clearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" Gifford argued gently, \"her statement is confirmed by the finding\n",
      "of the rope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith Morriston was thinking strenuously, desperately, he could see\n",
      "that. The words she spoke were but mechanical, the mere froth of a\n",
      "seething brain. Yet her splendid self-command--and he recognized it with\n",
      "admiration--never deserted her, however supreme the struggle may have\n",
      "been to retain it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A seat was by them; she went across the path to it and sat down. Gifford\n",
      "saw that she was deadly pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fear this wretched business is upsetting you, Miss Morriston,\" he said\n",
      "gently. \"Let me run to the house and fetch something to revive you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a gesture to stay him, and by an effort seemed to shake off the\n",
      "threatening collapse. \"No, no,\" she said; \"please don't. It is very\n",
      "stupid of me, but these repeated shocks are rather trying. You see one\n",
      "has never had any experience of the sort before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was more than stupid of me to blunder into the story,\" Gifford said\n",
      "self-reproachfully. \"But it never occurred to me--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no; of course not,\" she responded. \"And, after all, I am bound to\n",
      "hear all about it sooner or later. Sit down and tell me your opinion of\n",
      "the affair. Supposing the girl was not mistaken who do you think the\n",
      "person seen escaping from the window could have been?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is difficult to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A thief, no doubt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a natural conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not that I know of. I should say decidedly no definite idea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or Mr. Henshaw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever Mr. Henshaw's ideas may be he keeps them to himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Morriston checked the remark she had seemed about to make, and for a\n",
      "few minutes there was an awkward silence. Gifford broke it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so sorry that I have been unable to get any hint of his intentions.\n",
      "Believe me, it has not been for want of trying. But the man, for reasons\n",
      "best known to himself, seems determined to remain inscrutable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl was staring in front of her. \"Yes,\" she responded, with a catch\n",
      "of her breath; \"that is evident. But it does not much matter. I know you\n",
      "have tried your best to do what I was foolish enough to ask you. And now\n",
      "please do not think any more of it. In my ignorance of the man's\n",
      "character I set you an impossible task. All I can do now is to thank you\n",
      "for your sympathy and devotion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her tone pained him horribly. \"I hope, Miss Morriston,\" he replied\n",
      "warmly, \"you are not asking me to end my devotion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a little bitter laugh. \"Seeing that it is useless I have no\n",
      "right to ask its continuance,\" she replied almost coldly, \"nor to expect\n",
      "you to involve yourself in my--in our worries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if I ask to be allowed that privilege?\" he urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head. \"No, no, my friend,\" she insisted, with less warmth\n",
      "than the words implied, \"it can lead to no good and would be a mistake.\n",
      "Let the man alone. To involve yourself with him can bring you nothing but\n",
      "trouble. Promise me you will take no further heed of this unhappy\n",
      "business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned to him as she spoke the last words, and there seemed less\n",
      "trouble in her face than in his. For at his heart there was a sickening\n",
      "fear and suspicion of what the words portended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't promise that,\" he objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ask you; it is my wish,\" she returned with a touch of command.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my sake, or yours?\" he rejoined.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For both. Give me your promise. You must if we are to remain friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her look and the fascination in her voice seemed to pull the very heart\n",
      "out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are asking a cruelly hard thing of me,\" he replied, with a tremor in\n",
      "his voice. \"I don't understand--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you don't understand,\" she interrupted quickly. \"It is enough to\n",
      "know that you have taken a girl's foolish commission too seriously, so\n",
      "seriously as to run the risk of making things even worse than they\n",
      "threatened to be. Now I ask you to leave well alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it is well,\" he said doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course. Why should it not be?\" she rejoined, in a not very convincing\n",
      "tone. \"Now I shall rely on you--and I am sure it will not be in vain--to\n",
      "respect my wishes. Things seem to be in a horrible muddle,\" she added\n",
      "with a rather dreary laugh, \"but let's hope they will right themselves\n",
      "before long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She rose, compelling him to rise too. Something in the tone and manner of\n",
      "her last speech made him quite unwilling to end their conference, and\n",
      "desperately anxious to speak out everything that was in his mind and try\n",
      "to bring matters to a crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go for a moment,\" he said as she began to move away towards the\n",
      "house. \"I have something to say to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned quickly and faced him with a suggestion of displeasure in her\n",
      "eyes. \"What is it?\" she said with a touch of impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only this,\" he answered quietly. \"Have you lost a brooch, Miss\n",
      "Morriston?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the question the blood left her cheeks as it had done a little while\n",
      "before; then surged back till her face was suffused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A brooch? Yes; I have missed one. Have you found it?\" The words were\n",
      "spoken with a calmness which failed to hide the eagerness behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so,\" he answered, taking out his letter-case. \"A pearl, set in\n",
      "diamonds mounted on a safety-pin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the case and showed it pinned into the soft lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; that is mine,\" she said; and for a moment or two by a strange\n",
      "attraction each looked into the other's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford bent his head over the case as he unfastened the brooch and\n",
      "took it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where--where did you find it?\" Something in the girl's voice made him\n",
      "glad that he was not looking at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the garden,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the garden?\" she repeated. He was looking up now and saw the intense\n",
      "relief in her face. \"To-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; last time I was up here. I ought to have taken it to the house at\n",
      "once but--but it was a temptation to me to keep it till I could give it\n",
      "back to you like this. Do forgive me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was plain she divined what he meant, but her cold manner came to the\n",
      "aid of her embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am only too glad to have it again. I am so glad you found it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So am I,\" he responded with a touch of fervour. \"I wish I could relieve\n",
      "your mind of everything else as easily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure you do,\" she said wistfully, and impulsively half put\n",
      "out her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught it as she was in the act of checking the action and drawing it\n",
      "back. \"You may be sure--quite sure, of my devotion,\" he said, and raised\n",
      "her hand to his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "An exclamation and a sudden start as the hand was quickly withdrawn made\n",
      "him look up. Edith Morriston's eyes were fixed with something like fear\n",
      "on an object behind him. An intuition told him what it was before he\n",
      "looked round to see Henshaw, with his characteristic, rather stealthy\n",
      "walk, coming towards them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford set his teeth hard as the two faced round and awaited\n",
      "Henshaw's approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This man shall not annoy you,\" he said in an undertone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't quarrel with him, for heaven's sake,\" she entreated in the same\n",
      "tone, under her breath, as the disturbing presence drew near. There was\n",
      "a strange excitement in her voice, though none in the set face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think your brother is looking for you, Miss Morriston,\" Henshaw said\n",
      "in his even voice when he was within a dozen paces of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was just going to look for him,\" the girl replied in a voice strangely\n",
      "changed from that in which she had talked with Gifford. \"Isn't it lucky?\n",
      "Mr. Gifford has picked up in the garden a brooch I lost some days ago. I\n",
      "did not dare to tell Dick, as it was his gift.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw gave a casual glance at the ornament. \"I congratulate you,\" he\n",
      "responded coolly. Then Gifford saw his eyes seek hers as he added: \"Where\n",
      "was it found? Near the tower?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The covert malice of the insinuation was plain in the questioner's look,\n",
      "although the tone was casual enough.\n",
      "\n",

      "Nothing more of importance happened that day at Wynford, and Gifford had\n",
      "no further opportunity of private talk with Edith Morriston. But it was\n",
      "evident to him, and the knowledge gave him intense concern, that the girl\n",
      "went in fear of Gervase Henshaw. That he was intimidating her, and using\n",
      "his brother's death for that purpose, was beyond doubt, and the very fact\n",
      "that Edith Morriston was a woman of uncommon courage and self-control,\n",
      "one who in ordinary circumstances would be the last to give way to fear\n",
      "or submit to bullying, showed how serious the matter had become.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford on his part determined that this intolerable state of things must\n",
      "come to an end, and that in spite of the command laid upon him by the\n",
      "girl, he would now pit himself against her persecutor. He had given no\n",
      "actual promise, and even if he had it would have been drawn from him in\n",
      "ignorance of certain means which he possessed of help in this crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a significant circumstance which came to Gifford's knowledge a day or\n",
      "two after his interview with Edith Morriston in the garden of Wynford,\n",
      "was the cause of his beginning to take action without further delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk\n",
      "which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service\n",
      "at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park\n",
      "boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although\n",
      "towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in\n",
      "tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the\n",
      "highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of\n",
      "a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road\n",
      "he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the\n",
      "head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned,\n",
      "and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was\n",
      "sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his\n",
      "way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he\n",
      "glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it. He\n",
      "was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his\n",
      "identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why was he waiting there? Gifford asked himself the obvious question with\n",
      "a decidedly uneasy feeling. Henshaw the Londoner, on a Sunday evening,\n",
      "waiting with a horse and trap in an unfrequented lane, a road which ran\n",
      "nowhere but to a farm. What did it mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally Gifford's suspicions connected Edith Morriston with the\n",
      "circumstance, and yet he told himself the idea was monstrously\n",
      "improbable. It was more likely that Henshaw was bound upon some search\n",
      "with the police. His movements were and had been for some time\n",
      "mysterious enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford's impulse as he turned into the high road was to stay there in\n",
      "concealment and watch for the upshot of Henshaw's presence. The\n",
      "suggestion did not, however, altogether commend itself to him. He\n",
      "disliked the idea of spying even upon such a man as Henshaw, whom he had\n",
      "good reason to suspect of playing a dastardly game. It was probable, too,\n",
      "that Henshaw had recognized him and might be on the look-out; it would be\n",
      "intensely humiliating to be caught watching. So, turning the pros and\n",
      "cons over in his mind, Gifford walked slowly on in a state of\n",
      "irresolution till he came to a wicket-gate which admitted from the road\n",
      "to a path which ran through the churchyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he stopped, debating with himself whether he should turn back and\n",
      "keep an eye on Henshaw or go on into the church where service was just\n",
      "beginning. It did seem absurd to imagine that Henshaw with his conveyance\n",
      "could be waiting there by appointment for a girl of the character and\n",
      "position of Edith Morriston. True, he had seen them walking together in\n",
      "secret, which was strange enough, but that need not necessarily have been\n",
      "a planned meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an urgent curiosity had hold of him at the bare possibility of\n",
      "something wrong that he, temporizing with his scruples, was about to turn\n",
      "back to the lane, when he saw the figure of a woman coming towards him\n",
      "along the churchyard path. She was tall and so far as he could make out,\n",
      "muffled in a cloak and veil. His heart gave a leap, for although the\n",
      "woman's face and figure were indistinguishable the height and gait\n",
      "corresponded with those of Edith Morriston.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she came near the little gate where he stood she stopped dead, seemed\n",
      "to hesitate a moment, and then turned as though to go back. Determined to\n",
      "set his doubts at rest Gifford passed quickly through the gate and\n",
      "followed her at an overtaking pace. Evidently sensible of her pursuit,\n",
      "the woman quickened her steps and, as Gifford gained on her, turned\n",
      "quickly from the path, threading her way among the graves to escape him.\n",
      "She had gone but a few steps when in her hurry she tripped over the mound\n",
      "of a small, unmarked grave and fell to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford ran to her and taking her arm assisted her to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Morriston!\" he exclaimed, for he now was sure of her identity. \"I\n",
      "hope you are not hurt,\" he added mechanically, his mind full of a greater\n",
      "and more critical contingency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Gifford!\" she responded; but he was sure she had not recognized him\n",
      "then for the first time. \"Oh, no, thank you; I am not in the least hurt.\n",
      "It was stupid of me to trip and fall like that. Are you going to church?\"\n",
      "she added, evidently wishing to get away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was,\" he answered. \"And you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was too,\" she said, conquering her embarrassment, \"but I have a\n",
      "headache, and prefer the fresh air. Don't let me keep you,\" she held out\n",
      "her hand. \"Service has begun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hand. \"Miss Morriston,\" he said gravely, \"don't think me very\n",
      "unmannerly, but I am not going to leave you here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bright moonlight he could see her expression of rather haughty\n",
      "surprise. \"I think you are unmannerly, Mr. Gifford,\" she retorted\n",
      "defiantly. \"May I ask why you are not going to leave me here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" he answered with quiet decision, \"Mr. Henshaw is waiting just\n",
      "there in Turner's Lane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he?\" The same defiant note; but there was anxiety behind the\n",
      "cold pretence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. And pardon me, I have an idea he is waiting there for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His firm tone and manner baffled equivocation. \"What is it to you if he\n",
      "is?\" she returned with a brave attempt to suggest cold displeasure. But\n",
      "her lip trembled and her voice was scarcely steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is something to me,\" he replied insistently, \"because it means a\n",
      "great deal to you. This man is persecuting you. He is--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Gifford!\" she exclaimed. \"You take--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He held up his hand. \"Please let me finish, Miss Morriston. I can\n",
      "convince you that I am not taking too much upon myself. I am no fool and\n",
      "am not interfering without warrant. This man Henshaw has succeeded in\n",
      "persuading you that you are in his power. That is very far from being the\n",
      "case, and I can prove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand you, Mr. Gifford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone of cold annoyance was gone now. Relief and a vague hope seemed\n",
      "to be struggling with an almost overwhelming anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will understand directly,\" he replied. \"I have more than a suspicion\n",
      "that this man is seeking to connect you with his brother's death and is\n",
      "making use of a certain half-knowledge he possesses to get a hold over\n",
      "you. Is that not so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while she was silent, her breath coming quickly, as she hesitated\n",
      "how to meet the direct question. Gifford hated, yet somehow rejoiced, to\n",
      "see this proud, cold-mannered girl brought to this pass, and the reason\n",
      "he rejoiced lay in the knowledge that he could help her out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length she spoke. \"Mr. Gifford, I trust you as a man of honour. Your\n",
      "conjecture is right, but unhappily there is no help for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is help,\" he declared reassuringly. \"Can this man prove that you\n",

      "evening clothes had gone astray on the railway. There was no chance of\n",
      "its turning up at the hotel before ten o'clock, and I was therefore\n",
      "prevented from appearing at the dance till quite late. Naturally I would\n",
      "not hear of Kelson waiting for me, which like the good-natured fellow he\n",
      "is, he proposed to do; he therefore went off in good time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I remember he arrived quite early,\" Edith Morriston murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clement Henshaw,\" Gifford proceeded, \"left the hotel about the\n",
      "same time. They must have reached your house within a few minutes\n",
      "of one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he paused, his companion looked round at him inquiringly. \"Yes,\" she\n",
      "said, with a certain suggestion of reticence; \"I remember that too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford continued. \"Having seen Kelson off, I went up to our sitting-room\n",
      "to wait till my kit should arrive. I was very keen on seeing again the\n",
      "old place where in my young days I used to spend such happy months, and\n",
      "my enforced waiting soon became almost intolerable boredom. The result\n",
      "was that I got a fit of the fidgets; I could not settle down to read, and\n",
      "at last, having still an hour to spare, I resolved in my restlessness to\n",
      "stroll out and take a preliminary look from outside at what was\n",
      "practically my old home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\" There was a catch of growing excitement in Edith Morriston's\n",
      "voice, which was scarcely above a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The wind was sharp that night, as we all know,\" Gifford went on, \"and\n",
      "forbade loitering. A smart walk of fifteen or twenty minutes brought me\n",
      "here, knowing as I did every path and short cut across the park. The old\n",
      "familiar house looked picturesque enough with its many lighted windows\n",
      "and every sign of gaiety. Keeping away from the front entrance where\n",
      "carriages were constantly driving up and a good many people were about, I\n",
      "went round to the other side, avoiding the stables and passing along by\n",
      "the west wing. This, of course, brought me to the old tower, the scene of\n",
      "many a game and frolic in my young days. At its foot I stood for a while\n",
      "recalling memories of the past. In the mere idleness of affectionate\n",
      "remembrance I went up to the garden door of the tower and mechanically\n",
      "turned the handle. It was unlocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly know what made me go in; an impulse to stand again in those\n",
      "once familiar surroundings. It was fascinating to be in the old tower\n",
      "which the dim light showed me was just as I had last seen it more than a\n",
      "dozen years ago. The past came vividly back to me, and I stood there for\n",
      "a while indulging in a reverie of old days. The associations of the place\n",
      "seemed every moment to grip me more compellingly. The tower seemed quiet\n",
      "and altogether deserted; all I could hear was the dance-music away in the\n",
      "hall. There could be no risk, I thought, of being seen if I went up to\n",
      "the floor above: and I quietly ascended the stairs to the first landing.\n",
      "The narrow passage leading to the hall was lighted up with sconces; at\n",
      "its farther end I could see the movement of the dancers. The band was\n",
      "playing a favourite waltz of mine, and I stayed there rather enjoying the\n",
      "music and the sight from my safe retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It did not seem likely that any one would be coming to the tower, and\n",
      "I resolved, foolishly enough, for, of course, I was in my travelling\n",
      "suit, to wander up to the next floor and take a look at the room which\n",
      "held a rather sentimental association for me. It was a stupid thing to\n",
      "do as I was there in, for the moment, a rather questionable situation,\n",
      "still I felt pretty secure from being noticed, and went up warily to\n",
      "the next floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There I found the room considerably altered from my recollection of it,\n",
      "especially as it was arranged as a sitting-out room, but no one was\n",
      "there, nor were there any signs of its having been used, which from its\n",
      "rather secluded position, was natural enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having given a reminiscent look round I concluded that it would be best\n",
      "to make a retreat, especially as there would be ample opportunity later\n",
      "in the evening for me to visit it again. I turned and went to the door.\n",
      "On reaching the stairs I heard to my great annoyance the sounds of\n",
      "persons coming up and the subdued tones of a man's voice, I realized that\n",
      "I was caught, and my one chance of escape was to retreat up the topmost\n",
      "flight of stairs and wait in the darkness till the couple had gone into\n",
      "the room I had just quitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Accordingly I turned and went up the remaining flight on tip-toe, two\n",
      "stairs at a time, waiting beyond the turn in hiding till the coast\n",
      "should be clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The couple had now reached the landing below and, so far as I could\n",
      "tell, went into the room. I was just about to make a quick descent,\n",
      "hoping to get past that and other awkward points unnoticed, when to my\n",
      "dismay I became aware that the people whom I had thought safely settled\n",
      "in the room below had come out and were beginning to mount the topmost\n",
      "flight of stairs. This was indeed a most awkward predicament for me, and\n",
      "I debated for a moment whether my best course would not be to go boldly\n",
      "down the stairs and pass them, rather than retreat to the top room. If I\n",
      "had chosen the former course how differently things might have turned\n",
      "out; at any rate, for better or worse, the situation as it exists to-day\n",
      "might have presented itself in quite another form.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Treading noiselessly, I bolted up the remaining stairs and went into the\n",
      "dark room at the top. At the door, which stood open, I stopped and\n",
      "listened. To my intense vexation, for the situation was becoming\n",
      "decidedly unpleasant, the pair were still coming up. In silence now, but\n",
      "I could hear their approaching footsteps and the rustle of the lady's\n",
      "dress. Unfortunately, there was no corner on the top landing where I\n",
      "could stand hidden, so I was forced to draw back into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happily it had been so familiar to me from childhood that I could find\n",
      "my way about it in the dark. I well remembered the little inner room\n",
      "formed by the bartizan of the tower, and into this I tip-toed, feeling\n",
      "horribly guilty. If only I had not been in that suspicious brown suit! In\n",
      "evening clothes there would, of course, have been no necessity for this\n",
      "surreptitious retreat. I devoutly hoped that the two were merely bent on\n",
      "exploring the place and that the darkness of the old lumber-room would\n",
      "quickly satisfy their curiosity and send them down again. I heard them\n",
      "come into the room, the man speaking in a tone so low that the words were\n",
      "indistinguishable from where I stood; and then the sound of the door\n",
      "being shut struck my ear unpleasantly.\n",

      "breathing, dead silence in the room. Before speaking I had heard\n",
      "something like a long drawn sigh come from the man on the floor, but now,\n",
      "listening intently, I could hear nothing. Two explanations suggested\n",
      "themselves to account for his still lying there. One, shame at his vile\n",
      "conduct having been witnessed by a third person, the other that he had\n",
      "struck his head against the wall in falling and was stunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally I was not greatly concerned at the fellow's condition,\n",
      "whichever it was; still it would, I concluded, be well to settle the\n",
      "matter, and if he was merely skulking see that he cleared out of the\n",
      "house. I shut the door, and then crossing to where the man lay, struck a\n",
      "match and held it out to get a view of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He lay on his face with his arms bent under him. I prodded him with my\n",

      "match burned out; I struck another and leaned over to get a sight of his\n",
      "face. To my horror there met my eyes a dark wet patch on the floor which\n",
      "I instinctively felt must be blood. You may imagine the terrible thrill\n",
      "the conviction gave me. Yet I could not believe even then that anything\n",
      "really serious had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I struck a fresh match and holding it up with one hand, with the other\n",
      "took the man's shoulder and turned him over on his back. Then I knew that\n",
      "I was there with a dead man. The hue of the face was unmistakably that of\n",
      "death. And the cause of it was plainly to be seen. There was a wound in\n",
      "the man's neck from which blood came freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How had the wound--clearly a fatal one--been caused? I searched for an\n",
      "explanation. That which forced itself upon me was that the girl had in\n",
      "her desperation stabbed her persecutor with some weapon she had found\n",
      "there or brought with her. It was a horrible idea to entertain, although\n",
      "the act would have been almost justified. I wondered if by chance the\n",
      "weapon was still there. Striking a match I looked round. Yes; there on\n",
      "the floor near the spot where Henshaw had first fallen, lay a narrow\n",
      "blood-stained chisel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever my first conclusions were I can see now the most probable\n",
      "explanation of how Henshaw came by his death-wound. He had forced the\n",
      "chisel away from the girl; he had kept it in his hand; in his eagerness\n",
      "to prevent his victim's escape he had not realized that he was holding\n",
      "it point upwards, and when he fell it had pierced him with all the force\n",
      "of his heavy body falling plump on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you know it was an accident?\" Edith Morriston drew a great breath\n",
      "of relief from the painful tension with which she had listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can see it was a pure accident,\" Gifford answered. \"All the same it\n",
      "was an accident with an ugly look about it, and I quickly realized that I\n",
      "was in an equivocal--not to say dangerous, situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a terrible predicament for you,\" the girl said sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was indeed. And one which called for prompt action. Moreover the very\n",
      "fact that I was not in evening clothes made it all the more suspicious. I\n",
      "pulled my wits together and proceeded to make quite sure that the man was\n",
      "actually dead. That I found was beyond all doubt the case, and it now\n",
      "remained for me to make my escape before being found there in that\n",
      "hideous situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went out to the landing, closing the door after me, with the idea of\n",
      "getting down the stairs and escaping into the garden as secretly as I had\n",
      "come in. I had crept down a very few stairs when I found this was not to\n",
      "be. A chatter of voices just below told me that people were in the tower,\n",
      "and leaning over I could see couples passing between the passage to the\n",
      "hall and the room below me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any moment, I realized, some of them might take it into their heads\n",
      "to explore the topmost room, when the result would be disastrous.\n",
      "Certainly in my mufti I could not get past the next floor just then\n",
      "without exciting fatal notice, and to wait for an opportunity when the\n",
      "coast might be clear was too dangerous, seeing the risk of someone\n",
      "coming up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not easy to see my way of escape. I went to the top room and\n",
      "locked the door. My nerves were pretty strong, but they were severely\n",
      "tried when I shut myself in with the dead man and had the consciousness\n",
      "of having laid myself open to the charge of being his murderer. I stood\n",
      "there by the door thinking desperately what I could do. Fool that I had\n",
      "been to venture into the place in that garb. But who could have foreseen\n",
      "the result? Anyhow there was no time for reflection; it was necessary to\n",
      "act and seek a possible expedient. Hopelessly enough I went into the\n",
      "little inner room and struck a match. In a moment a thrill of hope came\n",
      "to me, for the first object the light showed me was a big coil of rope\n",
      "conspicuous among the odds and ends of lumber in the recess. The idea of\n",
      "escape by the window had only occurred to me to be dismissed as a sheer\n",
      "impossibility; the height of the tower made that quite prohibitive, but\n",
      "here seemed a chance of it. If only the rope was long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I got hold of the coil as my match burned out, and pulled it away from\n",
      "the surrounding rubbish. Its weight gave me hope that it would be\n",
      "sufficient. In haste I dragged it to the outer room into which the\n",
      "moonlight was now streaming. With a shuddering glance at the dead man,\n",
      "whose ashen face stared up in ghastly fashion in the moonbeams, I opened\n",
      "the window and looked out to make sure that no one was below. Satisfied\n",
      "on that point I brought forward the rope and began paying it out of the\n",
      "window. To my content I saw that there was a strong iron stanchion at the\n",
      "side which would allow of the rope being fastened to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was light enough just then to enable me to see pretty well when\n",
      "the end of the rope reached the ground, and upon examining what was left\n",
      "in the room I calculated that not much more than half was outside. In a\n",
      "flash the discovery gave me an idea. Why should I not simply pass the\n",
      "rope behind the stanchion and use it doubled? By that means I could pull\n",
      "it down after me when I reached the ground, and so not only effect my\n",
      "escape but also leave the fact unknown. That, together with the door\n",
      "locked on the inside, would tend to make Henshaw's death a mystery with a\n",
      "strong probability in favour of suicide, which would be altogether the\n",
      "happiest conclusion to arrive at. In fact my hastily formed calculation\n",
      "was, as we know, subsequently borne out and the suicide theory would\n",
      "probably have been quietly accepted had it not been for the intervention\n",
      "of Gervase Henshaw with his smartness and incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is practically the end of my story, Miss Morriston. I laid the\n",
      "chisel by the body, went to the window, pulled in the rope, carefully got\n",
      "the centre, adjusted it through the stanchion, and with a last look at\n",
      "the dead man, got out of the window, a rather nerve-trying business, and\n",
      "began to lower myself. I had calculated that the double rope was long\n",
      "enough to take me to within a few feet of the ground, and this proved to\n",
      "be the case. When I came to the end I let go of one side and pulled the\n",
      "other with me as I dropped. Then I drew the rope down, the latter half\n",
      "when released falling with a great thud. Hastily I set off for the lake,\n",
      "dragging the rope after me. At the landing-stage by the boat-house I\n",
      "coiled it up as best I could and threw it in. As I had anticipated it was\n",
      "thick and heavy enough to sink without being weighted. Then with a last\n",
      "glance at the tower I made my way as quickly as possible to the hotel in\n",
      "a state of nerves which you may imagine, little thinking that my descent\n",
      "from the tower had been witnessed. My first intention was to abandon all\n",
      "idea of going to the dance, but on reflection I came to the conclusion\n",
      "that I had better at least put in an appearance there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Accordingly I changed and came on late to the ball, as you know.\n",
      "Naturally a great curiosity possessed me to find out the girl who had\n",
      "played the third part in the drama which had been enacted in the tower.\n",
      "But I had not seen her face, nor heard her voice sufficiently to be able\n",
      "to recognize it. There were several tall girls in the room, yourself\n",
      "among the number, but naturally it never occurred to me--\"\n",

      "which all along he had studiously refrained from suggesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To suspect me,\" Edith Morriston completed his sentence with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he continued frankly. \"You would have been the last person to enter\n",
      "my head in that connexion. And then Kelson came out of the passage from\n",
      "the tower with Miss Tredworth, to whom he had just proposed. He\n",
      "introduced me in a way which suggested their new relationship, and we had\n",
      "just began to chat when to my horror I noticed what to my mind went to\n",
      "prove that she was the person for whom I was looking. There were dark red\n",
      "stains on the white roses she wore on her dress. It was an unpleasant\n",
      "shock to me, placing me, as it seemed, in a terribly difficult position.\n",
      "For, at the first blush of my discovery, it all seemed to fit in. Clement\n",
      "Henshaw had been, I imagined, in love with Miss Tredworth before Kelson\n",
      "appeared on the scene. She had thrown him over for my friend, and\n",
      "Henshaw, taking his rejection in bad part, had threatened to expose some\n",
      "questionable incident in her past. Now that is all happily explained\n",
      "away, and I won't retrace the steps by which my imagination led me on;\n",
      "but you see how painfully I was situated with respect to my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is my story, Miss Morriston. Had I known what I know now I should\n",
      "not have kept it to myself so long; but up to a certain point, until the\n",
      "last few days, there seemed no reason for making the dangerous secret\n",
      "known to any one. Now, when it appears necessary to protect you from this\n",
      "man, Henshaw, the account of the part I played in the tragedy must be\n",
      "told in your interest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith Morriston drew in a deep breath as Gifford ceased speaking. \"It is\n",
      "very kind and chivalrous of you, Mr. Gifford,\" she said in a low voice,\n",
      "\"to run this risk for me, although your telling me the story shall never\n",
      "involve you in danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am ready for your sake to face any danger the telling of my secret may\n",
      "hold for me,\" he responded firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that, as I am sure of you,\" she replied. Then added with a\n",
      "change of tone, \"You were certain for a while that Muriel Tredworth had\n",
      "not only been guilty of something discreditable in her past but had\n",
      "stabbed to death in your presence the man who knew her secret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid there seemed to me no alternative but to believe it,\" he\n",
      "acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you found out that you were mistaken in her identity and that she\n",
      "had nothing whatever to do with the tragedy you would naturally transfer\n",
      "the opinion you had held of her to--to the other woman--the one who was\n",
      "actually there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was put searchingly and was not to be evaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That would be a natural consequence,\" Gifford admitted frankly. \"But\n",
      "there was in my mind always a growing doubt whether the wound had not\n",
      "been given accidentally. And that doubt became almost certainty when the\n",
      "real identity of Henshaw's victim became apparent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith Morriston looked at him steadily. \"You know it--for certain?\" she\n",
      "asked almost coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally I cannot fail to know it now,\" he answered sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a rather bitter laugh. \"I shall not deny it to you, Mr. Gifford,\n",
      "even if I thought it could be of any use. But, knowing so much, you owe\n",
      "it to me to hear my explanation of matters which look so black against\n",
      "me, and above all to accept my absolute assurance that so far as I am\n",
      "concerned Clement Henshaw's wound was quite accidental. Indeed I never\n",
      "dreamt that he had been hurt until his body was found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford seized her hand by an irresistible impulse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Morriston, if you only knew how glad and relieved I am to hear you\n",
      "say that!\" he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you hear my story,\" she said, composedly but with an underlying\n",
      "bitterness which was hardly to be concealed, \"the story of a long\n",
      "martyrdom of persecution--for it has been nothing less--you will acquit\n",
      "me of being guilty of anything disreputable. What I did was innocent\n",
      "enough and it moreover was forced upon me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" he urged tenderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must tell you,\" she returned, \"if only to set myself right in your\n",
      "eyes who have been witness of the terrible sequel to it all. But not\n",
      "to-night; it is too late, and the story is long: it must be told at\n",
      "length. Dick will be home by this and I must go. I would ask you to come\n",
      "in, but there would be no opportunity for private talk there. Will you\n",
      "meet me to-morrow morning at half-past ten by the summer-house near the\n",
      "wood that runs up to James' farm? You know it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well. I will be there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is rather a long way for you to come,\" she said, \"but there are\n",
      "reasons for avoiding the big wood with the rides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" he replied. \"Henshaw might be on the look-out there for you.\"\n",
      "Then he added in answer to her quick look of curiosity, \"I happened once\n",
      "by accident to see him there with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes,\" she admitted with a shudder, \"I will tell you about that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I can guess,\" he said quietly. \"Now in the meantime you will\n",
      "take no notice of this man if he writes or tries to see you. He will\n",
      "probably be exasperated by your not keeping the appointment this evening\n",
      "and may determine to put the screw on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she agreed with a lingering fear in her voice.\n",
      "\n",

      "Next morning Gifford was in good time at the rendezvous, a sequestered\n",
      "corner of the park, and Edith Morriston soon joined him. \"Let us come\n",
      "into the summer-house,\" she suggested; \"it will be more convenient for my\n",
      "long story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First of all, tell me,\" Gifford said, \"has anything happened since last\n",
      "night? Has Henshaw made any move?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She took out a note and handed it to him. \"Only that,\" she said with an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There must have been some misunderstanding last evening,\" Gifford read.\n",
      "\"I cannot think that your not keeping the appointment was intentional.\n",

      "the church at 7.30. That you may not repent I hope you have not\n",
      "repented.\" That was all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A thinly veiled threat,\" Gifford observed. \"The man in his way seems as\n",
      "great a bully as his brother. May I keep this? I am going to see Mr.\n",
      "Henshaw presently, and have a serious talk with him. After which I shall\n",
      "hope to be able to convince you that your troubles are at an end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you can do that--\" she said.\n",

      "reward. I hope I am sufficiently a gentleman not to ask or expect\n",
      "any other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She made no reply. They had entered the little rustic summer-house,\n",
      "and sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick has driven into Branchester,\" Edith Morriston said, perhaps to end\n",
      "an embarrassing pause. \"He will not be back till luncheon, so we are not\n",
      "likely to be interrupted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's well,\" Gifford answered. \"Now please begin what I am most\n",
      "anxious to hear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The story I have to tell you, Mr. Gifford,\" Edith Morriston began, \"is\n",
      "not a pleasant one and is as humiliating to me to relate as was the\n",
      "experience, the terrible experience, I had to go through. But to be fair\n",
      "to myself I must be quite frank with you, and am sure you will never\n",
      "give me cause to repent speaking unreservedly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can rely upon my honour to respect your confidence,\" Gifford\n",
      "responded warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I may,\" the girl answered. \"Well, then, you must know first of\n",
      "all, that my father married a second time, and he unfortunately chose a\n",
      "woman well connected enough, but heartless and an utter snob. I suppose\n",
      "men are often blind to these hateful qualities before marriage; doubtless\n",
      "a clever, unscrupulous woman is able to hide her faults when she has the\n",
      "main chance in view. My stepmother was a good deal younger than my\n",
      "father, and I dare say on the whole made him, socially at any rate, a\n",
      "fairly good wife. Her one idea was social aggrandizement at any cost, and\n",
      "I unhappily was to fall a victim to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose we ought not to blame her for determining that I ought to\n",
      "marry well; she wanted to do the best for the family and was\n",
      "constitutionally incapable of making allowance for or considering any\n",
      "one's private feelings. To make a long story short, my stepmother, in\n",
      "pursuance of her policy, determined that I should marry a certain peer\n",
      "whose name I need not mention. He was altogether a bad lot, and I soon\n",
      "came to know it. I received certain warnings, but without them I could\n",
      "see that the man was all wrong, and I told my stepmother what I\n",
      "thought of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She scoffed at the idea that he was any worse than the average man. All\n",
      "I had to concern myself with was the fact that he was a peer of ancient\n",
      "lineage, of large property, and there wasn't another girl in the kingdom\n",
      "who wouldn't jump at him. I might well chance his making me unhappy since\n",
      "he could make me a countess, and to refuse him would be absolute madness;\n",
      "Mrs. Morriston's face grew black at the very thought of it. She soon got\n",
      "my father on to her side, and between them I had a hateful time of it.\n",
      "It's the old story, which will be told as long as there are worldly,\n",
      "selfish women on the earth, but it was none the less fresh and poignant\n",
      "to me who had to live through the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things got so bad through my continued refusal to fall in with my\n",
      "stepmother's wishes that I was reduced to a state bordering on despair.\n",
      "My father, whom I loved, was turned against me; his mind was so\n",
      "prejudiced in favour of the man whom I was being gradually forced to take\n",
      "as a husband that he could see no good reason, only sheer obstinacy, in\n",
      "my refusal. Altogether my life was becoming a perfect hell. Dick, who\n",
      "might have stood by me, and made things less unbearable, was away on a\n",

      "breezy, genial, young fellow, fond of fun and adventure and a pleasant\n",
      "contrast in every way to the man who was threatening to ruin my life. I\n",
      "don't know that in happier circumstances I should have cared for\n",

      "who, after the manner of her class, had acquired more than a sympathetic\n",
      "inkling of the way my people had been treating me, was waiting up on the\n",
      "look-out for my return, and quietly let me in. She told me that no one\n",
      "but herself had any idea that I was out of the house; she had led them to\n",
      "believe that I had gone to bed early with a headache, which considering\n",
      "the stress of the past two days was plausible enough. So I got back\n",
      "safely to my room which it had not seemed likely. I should ever enter\n",
      "again, and next morning I could see that my over-night's adventure was\n",
      "quite unsuspected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally I anticipated a continuation of my stepmother's attempts to\n",
      "force me into the marriage she had in view, and it rather puzzled me to\n",
      "understand why they seemed to be dropped. The prospective bridegroom did\n",
      "not come to the house, and, stranger still, his name was not mentioned.\n",
      "The explanation was soon forthcoming. I did not see the newspapers just\n",
      "then, in fact I have an idea they were purposely kept away from me; but\n",
      "some people who were calling mentioned a big society-scandal coming on in\n",
      "the Law Courts in which this precious peer was desperately involved. The\n",
      "relief with which I heard the news was unbounded considering all it meant\n",
      "for me, but my joy was turned to bitter grief by the news that Archie\n",
      "Jolliffe after lying unconscious for nearly a week had died of his\n",
      "injury. I had contrived, during the days he lingered, to make secret\n",
      "inquiries as to his condition, and so knew that what would have seemed my\n",

      "\"Poor fellow,\" Gifford commented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was unspeakably sad,\" Edith Morriston continued, \"but it seemed like\n",
      "fate, seeing how things rearranged themselves afterwards. Certainly if I\n",
      "was to blame for his piteous end, I was to pay the penalty. For no sooner\n",

      "\n",
      "\"On the day I heard of poor Archie's death I had gone out for a walk\n",
      "possessed by a great longing to be alone in my grief. On my way home by a\n",
      "woodland path leading to the Hall grounds, I, to my great annoyance, came\n",
      "upon Clement Henshaw. I can't say I was altogether surprised, for I had\n",
      "caught a glimpse of some one very like him in the village a day or two\n",
      "before. Of that I had thought little, merely taking care that the man did\n",
      "not see me. But now there was no avoiding him, and I had more than a\n",
      "suspicion that he had been lying in wait for me. At the risk of appearing\n",
      "horribly ungrateful I made up my mind on the instant to try to pass him\n",
      "with a bow, but need not say that was utterly futile. He stood directly\n",
      "in my path, and raised his hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I am sorry to be the bearer of sad news, Miss Morriston,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So he had found out my name, assuredly not by accident, and the fact\n",

      "\n",
      "\"From his manner I began to see that the man was likely to become an\n",
      "annoyance if he were not snubbed, but soon discovered that it was not so\n",
      "easily done. I thanked him coldly enough, and tried to dismiss him, but\n",
      "he insisted on walking with me. What could I do? He seemed determined to\n",
      "force his company upon me and I could not run away. He tried to get out\n",
      "of me how I had come to be driving with Archie that night, and although I\n",
      "evaded his questions it was plain that he had a shrewd inkling of the\n",
      "reason. Not to weary you with a long account of this disagreeable and\n",
      "humiliating affair, I will only say that from that day forward I became\n",
      "subject to a determined system of persecution from Clement Henshaw. He\n",
      "waylaid me on every possible occasion, holding over me a covert threat of\n",
      "the exposure of my escapade, till at last I was absolutely afraid to go\n",
      "outside the house for fear of meeting him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wanted to marry you?\" Gifford suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith Morriston gave a little shudder. \"I suppose so. He was always\n",
      "making love to me, and was quite impervious to snubbing. When, in\n",
      "consequence of my keeping within bounds of the house and garden, he could\n",
      "not see me, he took to writing, and kept me in terror lest one of his\n",
      "letters should fall into my stepmother's hands. I wished afterwards that\n",
      "I had taken a bold line, confessed what had happened, and defied the\n",
      "consequences. I think it was the fear of being disgraced in my brother's\n",
      "eyes on his return which kept me from doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the midst of my worry my father fell into a state of bad health and\n",
      "we took him down to the Devonshire coast for change of air. Needless to\n",
      "say Henshaw soon found out our retreat, and to my dismay appeared there.\n",
      "His persecution went on with renewed vigour and I, having less chance\n",
      "there of escaping it, was nearly at my wits' end, when fate curiously\n",
      "enough again intervened. We were caught in a storm on a long country\n",
      "excursion, my stepmother got a severe chill and within a week was dead.\n",
      "We returned to Haynthorpe, my father being now in a very precarious state\n",
      "of health, Henshaw followed us with a pertinacity that was almost\n",
      "devilish. But I now ventured to defy his threats of exposing me; he\n",
      "strenuously denied any such intention and declared himself madly in love\n",
      "with me. I had now taken courage enough to reject him uncompromisingly; I\n",
      "forbade him ever to speak to me again, and, as after that he disappeared\n",
      "from the village, began to flatter myself that I had got rid of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father grew worse now from day to day; he lingered through the summer\n",
      "and with the chill days of autumn the end came. Dick hurried home and\n",
      "arrived just in time to see him alive. He left a much larger fortune than\n",
      "we had supposed him to possess, and Dick, always fond of sport, was soon\n",
      "in negotiation for this place which had come into the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No sooner had we settled in here than, to my horror, Clement Henshaw\n",
      "began to renew his persecution. He had evidently heard that I had\n",
      "inherited a good share of my father's fortune, and was worth making\n",
      "another effort for. He recommenced to write to me, he came down secretly\n",
      "and waylaid me, and when everything else failed he resorted to threats,\n",
      "not veiled as before, but open and unmistakable. He vowed that if I\n",
      "persisted in refusing to marry him he would take good care that I should\n",
      "never marry any one else. He held, he said, my reputation in his hand; he\n",
      "hoped he should never have to use his power, but I ought to consider the\n",
      "state of his feelings towards me and not goad him to desperate measures.\n",
      "In short he took all the joy out of my life, for I had come from mere\n",
      "dislike simply to loathe the man who could show himself such a dastardly\n",
      "cad. And the worst of it was that I saw no way out of it. Dick is a good\n",
      "fellow and very fond of me, but, although you might not think it, he is\n",
      "almost absurdly proud of the family name and its unsmirched record. And\n",
      "if I had confided in him, and he had horsewhipped Henshaw, what good\n",
      "could that have done? It would simply have infuriated the man, who would\n",
      "have at once made public my escapade, and few people would have given me\n",
      "the credit of its being innocent. Dick had just sunk a large part of his\n",
      "fortune in this place, he had taken over the hounds and was certain of\n",
      "becoming popular. All that would be nullified and upset if this man,\n",
      "Henshaw, chose to let loose his tongue. For how could I even pretend to\n",
      "deny his story? At the very least the truth would mean a hateful\n",
      "reflection on my dead father, and the whole thing would have led to an\n",
      "intolerable scandal. Yet it seemed as though this could be avoided in no\n",
      "other way but by marrying my persecutor, a man whom I had reason to hate\n",
      "and who had shown himself to be such an unchivalrous bully. About this\n",
      "time--that is shortly before the Hunt Ball--rumours had got about the\n",
      "neighbourhood that I was going to marry Lord Painswick. He was certainly\n",
      "paying me a good deal of attention, and I fancy Dick would have liked\n",
      "the match, but I could not bring myself to care for Painswick, and indeed\n",
      "his courtship only added to my other worries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Clement Henshaw heard the rumour and it had naturally the effect of\n",
      "rousing his wretched pursuit of me to greater activity. He vowed with\n",
      "brutal vehemence that I should not marry Painswick, and declared that\n",
      "when our engagement was announced he would tell him the story he had\n",
      "against me. That in itself did not trouble me much since I had no\n",
      "intention of marrying Painswick; still the man's relentless persecution\n",
      "was getting more than I could bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I now come to the night of the Hunt Ball. For some days previously I had\n",
      "seen or heard nothing of Henshaw, and had even begun to hope that\n",
      "something might have happened to make the man abandon his line of\n",
      "conduct. I might have known him better. To my intense annoyance and\n",
      "dismay I saw him come into the ballroom with all the hateful assurance\n",
      "that was so familiar to me. I could not well escape, seeing that I was\n",
      "acting as hostess. For a while he, beyond a formal greeting, let me\n",
      "alone. But I felt what was surely coming, and it was almost a relief when\n",
      "he took an opportunity of asking for a dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He must have seen the hate in my eyes as in my hesitation they met his,\n",
      "for he said with a forced laugh, 'You need not do violence to your\n",

      "there is something I must say to you. Let us come out of the crowd to\n",
      "where we shall not be overheard.'\n",

      "would die rather than yield to him, that I led the way to the tower. My\n",

      "unexpected success of his search for Edith Morriston--for such doubtless\n",
      "was his object--had so disagreeably startled him, that he was unable to\n",
      "pull those sharp wits of his together at once. But the expression which\n",

      "\n",
      "No doubt with his knowledge of the world and of his own advantage Henshaw\n",

      "too old a legal practitioner to be bluffed. \"I do not for a moment admit\n",

      "superiority. \"I am addressing myself to Miss Morriston, who does not, I\n",

      "am sure Miss Morriston will endorse anything I choose to say to a man who\n",
      "has constituted himself her cowardly persecutor,\" he said. \"Now we don't\n",
      "want to have a dispute in a lady's presence,\" he added as Henshaw began\n",
      "an angry rejoinder. \"You have got, unless you wish very unpleasant\n",
      "consequences to follow, to render an account to me, as Miss Morriston's\n",
      "friend, of your abominable conduct towards her. But not here. You had\n",
      "better come to my room at the hotel at three o'clock this afternoon and\n",
      "hear what I shall have to say. And in the meantime you will address Miss\n",
      "Morriston only at the risk of a horsewhipping.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw was looking at him steadfastly through eyes that blazed with\n",

      "champion,\" he snarled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly,\" was the cool reply. \"A much wronged and cruelly persecuted\n",
      "lady. You had better postpone what you have to say till this afternoon,\n",
      "when we will come to an understanding as to your conduct. Now, as you are\n",
      "on private land, you had better take the nearest way to the public road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw looked as though he would have liked to bring the dispute to the\n",
      "issue of a physical encounter, had but the coward in him dared. \"I am\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Which has been rescinded by the vile use to which you have chosen to put\n",
      "it,\" Gifford rejoined. \"I have Miss Morriston's authority to treat you as\n",
      "a trespasser, and to order you off her brother's land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw fell back a step. \"Very well, Mr. Gifford,\" he returned with an\n",
      "ugly sneer. \"You talk with great confidence now, but we shall see. You\n",
      "will be wiser by this time tomorrow.\"\n",

      "With that he turned and walked off; Gifford, after watching him for a\n",
      "while, went back to the summer-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have put things in the right train there,\" he remarked with a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I do,\" he replied. \"He is obviously not an easy person to\n",
      "deal with. But I think I see my way. Tell me. He has threatened you in\n",
      "order to induce you to elope with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. He has found evidence among his brother's correspondence of the\n",
      "hold he had over me and of his persecution. That would afford a\n",
      "sufficient motive for my killing him; and how could I prove that I did\n",
      "not strike the blow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It might be difficult,\" Gifford answered thoughtfully. \"But I may be\n",
      "able to do it. Of course he knows you to be an heiress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that from something he once let slip. It has been my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes. This man must be something of an adventurer, as his brother was. We\n",
      "shall see,\" Gifford said with a grim touch. \"Now, I must not keep you\n",
      "any longer. I am so grateful for the confidence you have given me. May I\n",
      "call later on and tell you the result?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes were on him in an almost piteous searching for hope in his\n",

      "Punctually at the appointed time Gervase Henshaw was shown into\n",

      "they were refused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very kind of you, Harry,\" Gifford had said, \"and just what one\n",
      "would have expected from you. But, as you shall hear later, this is not a\n",
      "business in which you or any one could usefully intervene. In fact it\n",

      "almost genial; but Gifford was not the man to be deceived by that outward\n",
      "seeming. Henshaw bowed and took the chair the other indicated. There was\n",
      "a short pause as though each waited for the other to begin. In the end it\n",
      "was Gifford who spoke first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to come to an understanding with you, Mr. Henshaw, with\n",
      "regard to a very serious annoyance, not to say persecution, to which Miss\n",
      "Morriston has been subjected at your hands.\" Henshaw drew back his thin\n",
      "lips in a smile. \"I have to tell you,\" Gifford continued, \"once and for\n",
      "all that it must cease.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Morriston authorizes you to tell me that?\" The question was put\n",
      "with something like a sneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should hope it requires no authority,\" Gifford retorted. \"Having\n",
      "cognizance of what has been going on, it is my plain duty--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why yours?\" Henshaw interrupted coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For a very good reason,\" Gifford replied; \"one which I may have to tell\n",
      "you presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw Henshaw flush and dart a glance of hate at him. It was plain he\n",
      "had misinterpreted the reply. But the exhibition was only momentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Admitting in the meantime your right to interfere,\" Henshaw said, now\n",
      "with perfect coolness, \"allow me to tell you that you are taking a very\n",
      "foolish course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be glad to know how.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The reason is, that if you have any regard, as you suggest, for Miss\n",
      "Morriston, you are going the right way to do her a terrible injury.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford rose and stood by the fire-place. \"To come to the point at once\n",
      "without further preliminary fencing,\" he said quietly, \"you mean, I take\n",
      "it, that I am forcing you to denounce her as being guilty of your\n",
      "brother's death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant Henshaw seemed taken aback by the other's directness.\n",
      "\"There can be no doubt, holding the evidence I do, that she was guilty of\n",
      "it,\" he retorted uncompromisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Henshaw,\" Gifford objected with decision, \"there\n",
      "can be, and is, a very great deal more than a doubt of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw shot a searching glance at the man who spoke so confidently, as\n",
      "though trying to probe what, if anything, was behind his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you know then,\" he returned with his sneering smile, \"how\n",
      "otherwise, if the lady had no hand in it, my brother came by his death?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" was the quiet answer.\n",

      "to make it known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clearly,\" Gifford assented in a calm tone. \"That is why I asked you to\n",
      "come here this afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw was looking at him with a sort of malicious curiosity. In spite\n",
      "of his smartness he seemed at a loss to divine what the other was driving\n",
      "at, unless it were a well-studied line of bluff. But that Gifford could\n",
      "have, apart from what Edith Morriston might have told him, any intimate\n",
      "knowledge of the tragedy was inconceivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be glad to hear what you have to say, Mr. Gifford,\" he\n",
      "responded, in perhaps much greater curiosity than he chose to show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I have to inform you positively,\" Gifford answered, \"that your\n",
      "brother's fatal wound was the result of a pure accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming from Edith Morriston's champion, there was nothing surprising in\n",
      "that assertion. Certainly if that were the other's strong suit he could\n",
      "easily beat it. It was therefore in a tone of confidence and relief that\n",
      "he demanded, \"You can prove it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Miss Morriston's testimony?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all. By my own.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My own,\" Gifford repeated steadfastly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May one ask what you mean by that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw's contemptuous incredulity was by no means diminished even by the\n",
      "other's confident attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford gave a short laugh. \"Naturally you do not take my meaning.\n",
      "Obviously you think I am not a competent witness, that I know nothing\n",
      "except by hearsay. You are, extraordinary as it may seem, quite wrong.\n",
      "My testimony would be of nothing but what I myself saw and heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Henshaw had for a moment seemed to be calculating the\n",
      "probability of this monstrous suggestion being a fact, and had dismissed\n",
      "it with the contempt which showed itself in his question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean,\" Gifford replied with quiet assurance, \"that I happened to be a\n",
      "witness of the interview in the tower-room between your brother and Miss\n",
      "Morriston, that I was there when he received his death-wound, and that it\n",
      "was I whom the girl Haynes saw descending by a rope from the top window.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw had started to his feet, his face working with an almost\n",
      "passionate astonishment. \"You--you tell me all that,\" he cried, \"and\n",
      "expect me to believe it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have told you and shall tell you nothing,\" was the cool reply, \"that I\n",
      "am not prepared to state on oath in the witness-box.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while Henshaw seemed without the power to reply, dumbfounded, as\n",
      "his active brain tried to realize the probabilities of the declaration.\n",
      "\"It seems to me,\" he said at length in a voice of which he was scarcely\n",
      "master, \"that, whether your statement is true or otherwise, you are\n",
      "placing yourself in an uncommonly dangerous position, Mr. Gifford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am aware that I am inviting a certain amount of ugly suspicion,\"\n",
      "Gifford agreed, \"but the truth, which might have remained a mystery, has\n",
      "been forced from me by the necessity of protecting Miss Morriston.\n",
      "Perhaps you had better hear a frank account of the whole story, and the\n",
      "explanation of what I admit you are so far justified in setting down as\n",
      "concocted and wildly improbable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should very much like to hear it,\" Henshaw returned in a tone which\n",
      "held out no promise of credence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Gifford gave him a terse account of the events and the chance\n",
      "which had led him into the tower and to be a secret witness of what\n",
      "happened there. Remembering that he was addressing the dead man's\n",
      "brother, he recounted the details of the interview without feeling;\n",
      "indeed he threw no more colour into it than if he had been opening a\n",
      "case in court. He simply stated the facts without comment. Henshaw\n",
      "listened to the singular story in an attitude of doggedly unemotional\n",
      "attention. Lawyer-like he restrained all tendency to interrupt the\n",
      "narrative and asked no question as it proceeded. Nevertheless it was\n",
      "clear he was thinking keenly, eager to note any weak points which he\n",
      "could turn to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the recital had come to an end he said coolly--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your story is a very extraordinary one, Mr. Gifford; I won't call it, as\n",
      "it seems at first sight, wildly improbable, but it is at any rate an\n",
      "almost incredible coincidence. With your knowledge of the law I need\n",
      "scarcely remind you that the facts as you have just recounted them place\n",
      "you in a rather unenviable position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I have already said,\" Gifford replied, \"my story is calculated to\n",
      "suggest suspicion against me. But I am prepared to risk that\n",
      "consequence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In court,\" Henshaw observed, with a malicious smile, \"handled by a\n",
      "counsel who knew his business, your statement could be given a very ugly\n",
      "turn indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I have just told you,\" Gifford returned quietly, \"I would take that\n",
      "risk rather than allow Miss Morriston to remain longer under suspicion.\n",
      "As for myself I should have every confidence in the result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is well to be sanguine,\" Henshaw sneered. \"If you have not already\n",
      "done so, are you prepared to repeat your story to the police?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most certainly I am, if necessary,\" was the prompt answer. \"But I do not\n",
      "fancy you will wish me to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw's look was one of surprise, real or affected. \"Indeed? Why so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you,\" Gifford replied with a touch of sternness. \"Because it\n",
      "would be absolutely against your interest. For one thing it would, short\n",
      "of absolute proof, leave still the shadow of doubt over your brother's\n",
      "death, it would effectually put a stop to your designs on Miss Morriston,\n",
      "which in any case must come to an end, and it would show up your dead\n",
      "brother's character and conduct in a very disreputable light. Now what I\n",
      "have to say to you is this. I know that, following in your brother's\n",
      "footsteps, you have been subjecting Miss Morriston to an amount of very\n",
      "hateful persecution. There may have been a certain excuse for it, at any\n",
      "rate a degree of temptation, but your designs have not been welcome to\n",
      "the lady, and they must forthwith come to an end. Now unless you\n",
      "undertake to cease your attentions to Miss Morriston, in short to put an\n",
      "end at once and for all to this persecution, I shall effectually remove\n",
      "the hold you imagine you have over her by going straight to the police,\n",
      "giving them the real story of what happened in the tower that night and\n",
      "as a natural consequence shall give evidence to that effect at the\n",
      "adjourned inquest. You will know best whether it would be worth your\n",
      "while to force me to do this. I simply state the position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited for Henshaw's answer. The man was plainly cornered and seemed\n",
      "to be divided between a desire to let Gifford go on and place himself in\n",
      "a dangerous situation, and the more expedient course of raising a scandal\n",
      "which would touch him as well as disgrace his dead brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a clever piece of bluff, Mr. Gifford,\" he said at\n",
      "length; \"but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is no bluff at all,\" Gifford interrupted firmly. \"I am merely\n",
      "determined to take the obvious course to save Miss Morriston from\n",
      "something a good deal worse than annoyance. I have no wish to discredit\n",
      "the dead, but I must remind you that the persecution of Miss Morriston by\n",
      "your brother had gone on for a very considerable time, and had latterly\n",
      "developed into an atrocious system of bullying. It is not an occasion for\n",
      "mincing one's expressions, and I must say that in my opinion your own\n",
      "conduct has been very little, if any, better; and that will be the\n",
      "judgment of every decent man if the truth comes out, as come out it\n",
      "shall, unless you agree to my terms before you leave this room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while Henshaw made no reply. He sat thinking strenuously, evidently\n",
      "weighing his chances, estimating the strength of his adversary's\n",
      "position. Now and again he shot a glance, half probing, half sullen, at\n",
      "Gifford, who leaned back against the mantelpiece coolly awaiting his\n",
      "answer. At length he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a very fine piece of bravado, Mr. Gifford. But I am not such a\n",
      "fool as it pleases you to think me. It is very good of you to explain to\n",
      "me my position in this affair; I am, however, quite capable of seeing\n",
      "that for myself. And you can hardly expect me to look upon your\n",
      "gratuitous advice as disinterested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was talking to gain time; Gifford shrewdly guessed that. \"I\n",
      "might be pardoned for supposing you do not altogether realize how you\n",
      "stand,\" he replied quietly. \"But, after all, that is, as you suggest,\n",
      "your affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw forced a smile. \"The point of view is everything,\" he said in a\n",
      "preoccupied tone; \"and ours, yours and mine, are diametrically opposed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The point of view which perhaps ought most to be considered,\" Gifford\n",
      "retorted with rising impatience, \"is that of the honourable profession to\n",
      "which we both belong. If you are prepared to face the odium, professional\n",
      "and social, of an exposure--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw interrupted him with a wave of the hand. \"You may apply that to\n",
      "yourself and to your friend, Miss Morriston,\" he said sharply. \"I can\n",
      "take care of myself, thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford shrugged. \"Very well, then. There is no more to be said.\" He\n",
      "crossed the room and took up his hat. \"I will go and see Major Freeman at\n",
      "once.\" At the door he turned, to see with surprise and a certain\n",
      "satisfaction that Henshaw, although he had risen from his chair, seemed\n",
      "in no hurry to move. \"You are coming with me,\" he suggested. \"It would be\n",
      "quite in order, I think, for you to be present at my statement--unless\n",
      "you prefer not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed clear that the rather foxy Gervase Henshaw had really more than\n",
      "suspected a studied game of bluff. But now Gifford's attitude tended to\n",
      "put that out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the circumstances, as your statement will consist mainly of a slander\n",
      "against me and my dead brother,\" Henshaw replied sullenly, \"I prefer to\n",
      "keep out of the business for the present. I fancy,\" he added with an ugly\n",
      "significance, \"that the police will be quite equal to dealing with the\n",
      "situation without any assistance or intervention from me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gifford ignored the covert threat. \"Very well, then,\" he said, throwing\n",
      "open the door and standing aside for Henshaw to pass out; \"I will go\n",
      "alone. Yes; it will be better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Henshaw did not move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't quite gather,\" he said in answer to Gifford's glance of inquiry,\n",
      "\"exactly what your object is in taking this step.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have thought--\" Gifford began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it,\" Henshaw proceeded, falling back now to his ordinary lawyer-like\n",
      "tone--\"is it merely to checkmate what you are pleased to call my designs\n",
      "upon Miss Morriston?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will be a mere incidental result,\" Gifford answered, shutting the\n",
      "door and coming back into the room. \"My object is to put it, at once and\n",
      "for all, out of your power to hold over Miss Morriston the threat that\n",
      "she is at any moment liable to be accused--by you of all people--of your\n",
      "brother's murder, and so suggest that she is in your power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you say by me, of all people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You who profess an affection for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your word profess scarcely does me justice, Mr. Gifford,\" Henshaw\n",
      "returned, drawing back his shut lips. \"I had, and have, a very sincere\n",
      "affection for Edith Morriston, which, it seems, I am not to be allowed to\n",
      "declare or even have credit for. As a man of the world you can hardly\n",
      "pretend to be ignorant of what a man will do when his happiness is at\n",
      "stake. What he does under such a stress is no guide to his real feelings.\n",
      "But we need not labour that point. My affection, genuine or not, seems to\n",
      "be in no fair way to be requited, and I had already made up my mind to\n",
      "leave it at that. I have merely kept up the game to this point out of\n",
      "curiosity to see how far your--shall we say knight-errantry?--would lead\n",
      "you. I will now relieve you from the necessity of going through an act of\n",
      "Quixotic folly which would assuredly, sooner or later, have unpleasant\n",
      "consequences for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Gifford realized with a thrill of pleasure that he had won. He felt\n",
      "that in much of his speech the man was lying; that no consideration of\n",
      "mere unrequited affection had induced him to abandon his design.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad to hear you have come to a sensible conclusion,\" he said as\n",
      "coolly as the sense of triumph would let him. \"Whatever happened you\n",
      "could hardly have expected your--plans to succeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know that,\" Henshaw retorted, with a touch of a beaten man's\n",
      "malice. \"Anyhow I have my own ideas on the subject. But looking into the\n",
      "future with my brother's blood between us I think it might have turned\n",
      "out a hideous mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A safe conjecture,\" Gifford commented, between indignation and amusement\n",
      "at the cool way the man was now trying to save his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyhow there's an end of it,\" Henshaw said with an air and gesture of\n",
      "half scornfully dismissing the affair. \"And so I bid you good afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked towards the door Gifford intercepted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite so fast, Mr. Henshaw,\" he said resolutely. \"We can't leave the\n",
      "affair like this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Henshaw ejaculated, with a look which was half\n",
      "defiant, half apprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard my story,\" Gifford pursued with steady decisiveness,\n",
      "\"and have, I presume, accepted it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For what it is worth.\" The smart of defeat prompted the futile reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That won't do at all,\" Gifford returned with sternness. \"You either\n",
      "accept the account I have just given you, or you do not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something like murder in Henshaw's eyes as he replied, \"This\n",
      "bullying attitude is what I might expect from you. To put an end,\n",
      "however, to this most unpleasant interview you may take it that I accept\n",
      "your statement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the absolute exoneration of Miss Morriston?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must have your assurance in writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw fell back a step and for a moment showed signs of an\n",
      "uncompromising refusal. \"You are going a little too far, Mr. Gifford,\"\n",
      "he said doggedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" Gifford retorted. \"It is imperatively necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it?\" Henshaw sneered. \"For what purpose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For Miss Morriston's protection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sneer deepened. \"I should have thought that purpose quite negligible,\n",
      "seeing how valiantly the lady is already protected. But I have no\n",
      "objection,\" he added in an offhand tone, \"as you seem to distrust the\n",
      "lasting power of bluff, to give you an extra safeguard. Indeed I think it\n",
      "just as well, all things considered, that Miss Morriston should have it.\n",
      "Give me a pen and a sheet of paper.\" Henshaw's manner was now the\n",
      "quintessence of insolence, but Gifford could afford, although it cost him\n",
      "an effort, to ignore it. With the practised pen of a lawyer Henshaw\n",
      "quickly wrote down a short declaration, signing it with a flourish and\n",
      "then flicking it across the table to Gifford. \"That should meet the\n",
      "case,\" he said, leaning back confidently and thrusting his hands into his\n",
      "pockets. Dealing with one who, like himself, was learned in the law he\n",
      "had, to save trouble, written a terse declaration which he knew should be\n",
      "quite acceptable. It simply stated that from certain facts which had come\n",
      "to his knowledge he was quite satisfied that his brother's death had been\n",
      "caused by an accident, and that no one was to blame for it, and he\n",
      "thereby undertook to make no future charge or imputation against any one,\n",
      "in connexion therewith.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that will do,\" Gifford answered curtly when he had read the\n",
      "few lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henshaw rose with a rather mocking smile. \"I congratulate you on\n",
      "your--luck, Mr. Gifford,\" he said with a studied emphasis, and so\n",
      "left the room.\n",

      "GIFFORD'S REWARD\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the precious declaration in his pocket Gifford lost no time in going\n",
      "to Wynford Place. His light heart must have been reflected in his face,\n",
      "for Edith Morriston's anxious look brightened as she joined him in the\n",
      "drawing-room. All the same it seemed as though she almost feared to ask\n",
      "the result, and he was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I bring you good news, Miss Morriston. You have nothing more to fear\n",
      "from Gervase Henshaw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" She caught her breath, and for a moment seemed unable to respond.\n",
      "\"Tell me,\" she said at length, almost breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have had a long and, as you may imagine, not very pleasant interview\n",
      "with the fellow,\" he answered quietly; \"and am happy to say I won all\n",
      "along the line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won? You mean--?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had taken the declaration from his pocket-book and for answer handed\n",
      "it to her. With a manifest effort to control her feelings she read it\n",
      "eagerly. Then her voice trembled as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Gifford, what can I say? I wish I knew how to thank you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't try,\" he replied lightly. \"If you only knew the pleasure it\n",
      "has given me to get the better of this fellow you would hardly consider\n",
      "thanks necessary. Would you care to hear a short account of what\n",
      "happened?\" he added tactfully, with the intention, seeing how painful the\n",
      "revulsion was, of giving her time to recover from her agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please; do tell me.\" She spoke mechanically, still hardly able to trust\n",
      "her voice above a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat down and he related the salient points of his interview with\n",
      "Henshaw. \"It was lucky that I happened to have something of a hold over\n",
      "him,\" he concluded with a laugh; \"Mr. Gervase Henshaw is not wanting in\n",
      "determination, and it took a long time to persuade him that he could not\n",
      "possibly win the game he was playing; but he stood to lose more heavily\n",
      "than he could afford. The conclusion, however, was at last borne in upon\n",
      "him that the position he had taken up was untenable, and that paper is\n",
      "the result.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That paper,\" she said in a low voice, \"means life to me instead of a\n",
      "living death; it means more than I can tell you, more than even you can\n",
      "understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had risen, but before he could speak she had come to him and\n",
      "impulsively taken his hand. \"Mr. Gifford,\" she said, \"tell me how I can\n",
      "repay you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes met his; they were full of gratitude and something more. But he\n",
      "resisted the temptation to answer her question in the way it was plain to\n",
      "him he was invited to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is reward enough for me to have served you,\" he responded steadily.\n",
      "\"Seeing that chance gave me the power, I could do no less.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would have risked your life for mine,\" she persisted, her eyes\n",
      "still on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hardly that,\" he returned, with an effort to force a smile. \"But had it\n",
      "been necessary, I should have been quite content to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you will not tell me how I can show my gratitude?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not do it for reward,\" he murmured, scarcely able to\n",
      "restrain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that,\" she assented. \"But you once hinted, or at any rate\n",
      "led me to believe, that I could repay you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be no pretence of ignoring her meaning now. Still he felt\n",
      "that chivalry forbade his acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wrong,\" he replied with an effort, \"and most unfair if I suggested\n",
      "a bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you repented the suggestion?\" she asked almost quizzingly and with\n",
      "a curious absence of her characteristic pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only in a sense,\" he answered. \"I hope I am too honourable to take an\n",
      "unfair advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed now; joyously, it seemed. \"If your scruples are so strong\n",
      "there will be nothing for it but for me to throw away mine and offer\n",
      "myself to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Edith,\" he exclaimed in a flash of rapture, then, checked the passionate\n",
      "impulse to take her in his arms. \"You must not; not now, not now. It is\n",
      "not fair to yourself. At the moment of your release from this horrible\n",
      "danger you cannot be master of yourself. You must not mistake gratitude\n",
      "for love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edith drew back with a touch of resentful pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you think I don't know my own mind--\" she began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does any one know his own mind at such a crisis as you have just passed\n",
      "through?\" he said, a little wistfully. \"Edith,\" he went on as he took her\n",
      "unresisting hand, \"you must not be offended with me. Think. The whole\n",
      "object of what I have done for you has been to set you free, as free as\n",
      "though you had woke up to find the episode of these Henshaws had been no\n",
      "more than a horrible dream. You must be free, you must realize and enjoy\n",
      "your freedom. You are now relieved from the crushing weight you have\n",
      "borne so long; the release must be untouched by the shadow of a bargain\n",
      "expressed or implied. That is the only way in which a man of honour can\n",
      "regard the position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" she returned simply, \"I understand. I am sorry for my\n",
      "mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her manner shook his resolution. \"I can't think you understand,\" he\n",
      "replied forcibly. \"I only ask, in fairness to yourself, for time. Don't\n",
      "think that I am not desperately in love with you. You must have seen it,\n",
      "ever since our first confidential talk, that night at the Stograve dance.\n",
      "And my love has gone on increasing every day till--oh, you don't know how\n",
      "cruelly hard it is to resist taking you at your word. But I can't, I\n",
      "simply can't snatch at an unfair advantage, however great the temptation.\n",
      "I must give you time, time to know your own heart when the nightmare\n",
      "shall have passed away. I propose to return to town as soon as this man\n",
      "Henshaw has cleared out of the neighbourhood. Will you let us be as we\n",
      "are for a month, Edith, and if then you are of the same mind, send me a\n",
      "line and I will come to you by the first train. Is not that only fair?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a little sigh of contentment. \"Very well,\" she said, \"if that\n",
      "will satisfy you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hand. \"It will seem a horribly long time to wait; but I\n",
      "feel it is right. Today is the 16th; on this day month I shall hear\n",
      "from you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, on the 16th,\" she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so,\" he said, \"you are free, unless you call me back to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is understood,\" she said with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "He might have kissed her lips, her look into his eyes was almost an\n",
      "invitation, but, having steeled himself to be scrupulously fair, he\n",
      "refrained and contented himself with kissing her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the hotel he heard with satisfaction that Henshaw had gone\n",
      "off by the late afternoon train and had suggested the unlikelihood of his\n",
      "returning. \"So I suppose he is content to let the mystery remain a\n",
      "mystery,\" the landlord remarked. And the Coroner's jury subsequently had\n",
      "perforce to come to the same conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 16th of the following month, Hugh Gifford's impatience and\n",
      "anxiety were set at rest, as the morning's post brought the expected\n",
      "letter from Wynford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dick and I are expecting you here tomorrow, unless you have changed your\n",
      "mind--I have not. The 3.15 train shall be met if you do not wire to the\n",
      "contrary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Gifford jumped out of the 3.15 Edith was on the platform. As they\n",
      "shook hands he read in her eyes an unwonted happiness and knew for\n",
      "certain that all was well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had something to do in the town and thought I might as well come on to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you have not added even a half-hour to this long month,\" he\n",

      "A QUESTION OF MIDSHIPMAN HONOR\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can a midshipman and gentleman act in that way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice of Midshipman David Darrin, United States Navy, vibrated\n",
      "uneasily as he turned to his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a shame--that's what it is,\" quivered Mr. Farley, also of the\n",
      "third class at the United States Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the question is,\" propounded Midshipman Dan Dalzell, \"what are we\n",
      "going to do about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it any part of our business to bother with the fellow?\" demanded\n",
      "Farley half savagely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Farley was rather hot-tempered, though he was \"all there\" in points\n",
      "that involved the honor of the brigade of midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five midshipmen stood in the squalid, ill-odored back room of a Chinese\n",
      "laundry in the town of Annapolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sixth midshipman present in the handsome blue uniform of the\n",
      "brigade; and it was upon this sixth one that the anger and disgust of\n",
      "the other five had centered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay in a sleep too deep for stirring. On the still, foul air floated\n",
      "fumes that were new to those of his comrades who now gazed down on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To think that one of our class could make such a beast of himself!\"\n",
      "sighed Dave Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And on the morning of the very day we're to ship for the summer\n",
      "cruise,\" uttered Farley angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well\" growled Hallam, \"why not let this animal of lower grade sleep\n",
      "just where he is? Let him take what he has fairly brought upon himself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the very question that is agitating me,\" declared Dave Darrin,\n",
      "to whom these other members of the third class looked as a leader when\n",
      "there was a point involving class honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave had became a leader through suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Readers of the preceding volume in this series, \"DAVE DARRIN'S FIRST\n",
      "YEAR AT ANNAPOLIS,\" will need no introduction to this fine specimen of\n",
      "spirited and honorable young American.\n",
      "\n",
      "Readers of that preceding volume will recall how Dave Darrin and Dan\n",
      "Dalzell entered the United States Naval Academy, one appointed by a\n",
      "Congressman and the other by a United States Senator. Such readers will\n",
      "remember the difficult time that Dave and Dan had in getting through the\n",
      "work of the first hard, grinding year. They will also recall how Dave\n",
      "Darrin, when accused of treachery to his classmates, patiently bided his\n",
      "time until he, with the aid of some close friends, was able to\n",
      "demonstrate his innocence. Our readers will also remember how two\n",
      "evil-minded members of the then fourth class plotted to increase Damn's\n",
      "disgrace and to drive him out of the brigade; also how these two\n",
      "plotters, Midshipmen Henkel and Brimmer, were caught in their plotting\n",
      "and were themselves forced out of the brigade. Our readers know that\n",
      "before the end of the first year at the Naval Academy, Dave had fully\n",
      "reinstated himself in the esteem of his manly classmates, and how he\n",
      "quickly became the most popular and respected member of his class.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now only the day after the events whose narration closed the\n",
      "preceding volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Darrin and Dalzell were first of all brought to notice in \"THE HIGH\n",
      "SCHOOL BOYS' SERIES.\" In their High School days, back in Gridley, these\n",
      "two had been famous members of Dick & Co., a sextette of youngsters who\n",
      "had made a name for themselves in school athletics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, two other members of the sextette, had\n",
      "been appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point,\n",
      "where they were serving in the corps of cadets and learning how to\n",
      "become Army officers in the not far distant future. All of the\n",
      "adventures of Dick and Greg are set forth in \"THE WEST POINT SERIES.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two remaining members of famous old Dick & Co., Tom Reade and Harry\n",
      "Hazelton, became civil engineers, and went West for their first taste of\n",
      "engineering work. Tom and Harry had some wonderful and startling\n",
      "adventures, as fully set forth in \"THE YOUNG ENGINEERS' SERIES.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On this early June day when we again encounter Dave Darrin and Dan\n",
      "Dalzell in their handsome Naval uniforms, all members of the first,\n",
      "second and third classes were due to be aboard one of the three great\n",
      "battleships that lay off the Yard at Annapolis at four p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three great battleships were the \"Massachusetts,\" the \"Iowa\" and\n",
      "the \"Indiana.\" These three huge, turreted fighting craft had their full\n",
      "crews aboard. Not one of the battleship commanders would allow a\n",
      "\"jackie\" ashore, except on business, through fear that many of the\n",
      "\"wilder\" ones might find the attractions on shore too alluring, and fail\n",
      "to return in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the young midshipmen it was different. These young men were\n",
      "officially and actually gentlemen, and could be trusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet here, in the back room of this laundry, was one who was apparently\n",
      "not dependable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young midshipman's name was Pennington, and the fact was that he\n",
      "lay in deep stupor from the effects of smoking opium!\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been a storekeeper, with a shop across the street, who had called\n",
      "the attention of Dave and his four comrades to the probable fate of\n",
      "another of their class.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow Hop runs a laundry, but I have heard evil stories about a lot of\n",
      "young fools who flock to his back room and get a chance to 'hit' the\n",
      "opium pipe,\" the storekeeper had stated to Dave. \"One of your men, or at\n",
      "least, one in a midshipman's uniform, went in there at eleven o'clock\n",
      "this forenoon, and he hasn't been out since. It is now nearly two\n",
      "o'clock and, I've been looking for some midshipmen to inform.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such had been the storekeeper's careful statement. The merchants of\n",
      "Annapolis always have a kindly feeling toward these fine young\n",
      "midshipmen. The storekeeper's purpose was to enable them to help their\n",
      "comrade out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the five had entered the laundry. The proprietor, Chow Hop, had\n",
      "attempted to bar their way to the rear room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dave had seized the yellow man and had flung him aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader already knows what they discovered, and how it affected these\n",
      "young men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring that copper-colored chink in here, if you'll be so good,\"\n",
      "directed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan and Hallam departed on the quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're wanted in there,\" proclaimed Dalzell, jerking a thumb over his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby,\" replied Chow Hop, looking up briefly from his ironing\n",
      "board.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get in there--do you hear?\" commanded Hallam, gripping the other's arm\n",
      "with all his force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lemme go chop-chop (quickly), or you get alle samee hurt--you\n",
      "sabby?\" scowled Chow Hop, using his free hand to raise a heavy flat-iron\n",
      "menacingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dan Dalzell jumped in, giving the Chinaman's wrist a wrench that\n",
      "caused him to drop the iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, without a bit of ceremony, Dan grasped the Oriental by the\n",
      "shoulders, wheeled him about, while he protested in guttural tones, and\n",
      "bluntly kicked the yellow-faced one through the door into the inner\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this summary proceeding both the Chinese helpers gripped their\n",
      "flat-irons firmly; and leaped forward to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an ugly temper the Chinaman is a bad man to oppose. But now this pair\n",
      "were faced by a pair of quietly smiling midshipmen who were also\n",
      "dangerous when angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You two, get back,\" ordered Dalzell, advancing fearlessly upon the\n",
      "pair. \"If you don't, we'll drag you out into the street and turn you\n",
      "over to the policemen. You 'sabby' that? You heathen are pretty likely\n",
      "to get into prison for this day's work!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scowling for a moment, then muttering savagely, the two helpers slunk\n",
      "back to their ironing boards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, while Dan turned to go into the rear room, Hallam stood just where\n",
      "he was, to keep an eye on two possible sources of swift trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow Hop,\" began Dave Damn sternly, as the proprietor made his flying\n",
      "appearance, \"You've done a pretty mean piece of work here\"--pointing to\n",
      "the unconscious midshipman in the berth. \"Do you understand that you're\n",
      "pretty likely to go to prison for this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that no maller,\" replied Chow, with a sullen grin. \"Him plenty\n",
      "'shipmen come here and smoke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lie!\" hissed Dave, grasping the heathen by the collar and shaking\n",
      "him until the latter's teeth rattled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dave gave him a brief rest, though he still retained his hold on\n",
      "the Chinaman's collar. But the yellow man began struggling again, and\n",
      "Dave repeated the shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow Hop had kept his hands up inside his wide sleeves. Now Farley\n",
      "leaped forward as he shouted:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out, Darry! He has a knife!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farley attempted to seize the Chinaman's wrist, for the purpose of\n",
      "disarming the yellow man, but Dave swiftly threw the Chinaman around out\n",
      "of Farley's reach. Then, with a lightning-like move, Dave knocked the\n",
      "knife from Chow Hop's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pick that up and keep it for a curio, Farley,\" directed Dave coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another twinkling Darrin had run the Chinaman up against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smack! biff! thump!\n",
      "\n",
      "With increasing force Dave's hard fist struck the heathen in the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now stand there and behave yourself,\" admonished Midshipman Dave,\n",
      "dropping his hold on the yellow man's collar, \"or we'll stop playing\n",
      "with you and hurt you some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The scowl on Chow Hop's face was ominous, but he stood still, glaring at\n",
      "Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chow, what can we do to bring this man out of his sleep!\" asked Dave\n",
      "coolly, and almost in a friendly tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby,\" sulked the Chinaman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you do,\" retorted Dave warningly. \"Now, what can we do to get our\n",
      "friend out of this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You allee same cally (carry) him out,\" retorted Chow, with a suspicion\n",
      "of a sulky grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of that, now, you yellow-face!\" glared Dave. \"How shall we get our\n",
      "comrade out of this opium sleep!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me no sabby no way,\" insisted Chow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you do!\" snapped Dave. \"But you won't tell. All right; we'll\n",
      "find the way, and we'll punish you into the bargain. Dan, get a piece of\n",
      "paper from the other room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dalzell was quickly back with the desired item. On the paper Dave wrote\n",
      "a name and a telephone number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's near the end of the doctor's office hours,\" murmured Dave. \"Go to\n",
      "a telephone and ask the doctor to meet you at the corner above. Tell him\n",
      "it's vastly important, and ask him to meet you on the jump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell him what's up!\" asked Dan cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; you'd better. Then he'll be sure to bring the necessary remedies\n",
      "with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Dalzell was off like a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow tried to edge around toward the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, you get back there,\" cried Dave, seizing the Chinaman and\n",
      "slamming him back against the wall. \"Don't you move again, until we tell\n",
      "you that you may--or it will be the worse for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes passed ere Dan returned with Dr. Lawrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see the job that's cut out for you,\" said Darrin, pointing to the\n",
      "unconscious figure in the bunk. \"Can you do it, Doctor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The medical man made a hasty examination of the unconscious midshipman\n",
      "before he answered briefly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will it be a long job, Doctor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifteen minutes, probably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, good, if you can do it in that time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me go now?\" asked Chow, with sullen curiosity, as the medical man\n",
      "opened his medicine-case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; if you don't try to leave the joint,\" agreed Dave. \"And I'm going\n",
      "outside with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chow looked very much as though he did not care for company, but\n",
      "Midshipman Darrin kept at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, see here, Chow,\" warned Dave, \"this is the last day you sell\n",
      "opium for white men to smoke!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You heap too flesh (fresh)\" growled the Chinaman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the last day you'll sell opium to white men,\" insisted Dave, \"for,\n",
      "as soon as I'm through here I'm going to the police station to inform\n",
      "against you. They'll go through here like a twelve-inch shot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You alle same tell cop?\" grinned Chow, green hatred showing through his\n",
      "skin. \"Then I tell evelybody about you fliend in there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do just as you please about that,\" retorted Dave with pretended\n",
      "carelessness. \"For one thing, you don't know his name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I do,\" swaggered Chow impudently. \"Know heap 'bout him. His\n",
      "name alle same Pen'ton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seizing a marking brush and a piece of paper, Chow Hop quickly wrote out\n",
      "Pennington's name, correctly spelled. His ability to write English with\n",
      "a good hand was one of Chow's great vanities, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You go back to your ironing board, yellow-face,\" warned Darrin, and\n",
      "something in the young third classman's face showed Chow that it would\n",
      "be wise to obey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hallam drew Darrin to one side, to whisper earnestly in his ear:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out, old man, or you will get Pen into an awful scrape!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shan't do it,\" maintained Darrin. \"If it happens it will have been\n",
      "Pen's own work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better let the chink go, just to save one of our class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is a fellow who has turned opium fiend worth saving to the class!\"\n",
      "demanded Dave, looking straight into Hallam's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, er--er--\" stammered the other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see,\" smiled Dave, \"the doubt hits you just as hard as it does me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, of course, a fellow who has turned opium fiend is no fellow ever to\n",
      "be allowed to reach the bridge and the quarter-deck,\" admitted Hallam.\n",
      "\"But see here, are you going to report this affair to the commandant of\n",
      "midshipmen, or to anyone else in authority?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no occasion to report,\" replied Dave dryly. \"I am not in any way\n",
      "in command over Pennington. But I mean to persuade him to report himself\n",
      "for what he has done!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that would ruin him!\" protested Hallam, aghast. \"He wouldn't even\n",
      "be allowed to start on the cruise. He'd be railroaded home without loss\n",
      "of a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you've just said that an opium-user isn't fit to go on in the\n",
      "brigade,\" retorted Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang it, it's hard to know what to do,\" rejoined Hallam, wrinkling his\n",
      "forehead. \"Of course we want to be just to Pen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't strike me as being just exactly a question of justice to\n",
      "Pennington,\" Darrin went on earnestly. \"If this is anything it's a\n",
      "question of midshipman honor. We fellows are bound to see that all the\n",
      "unworthy ones are dropped from the service. Now, a fellow who has\n",
      "fastened the opium habit on himself isn't fit to go on, is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, say, but this is a hard one to settle!\" groaned Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll take all the responsibility upon myself,\" said Dave promptly.\n",
      "\"I don't want to make any mistake, and I don't believe I'm going to.\n",
      "Wait just a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Going to the rear room, Dave faced his three comrades there with the\n",
      "question:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You three are enough to take care of everything here for a few minutes,\n",
      "aren't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" nodded Dan. \"What's up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallam and I are going for a brief walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, stepping back into the front room, Darrin nodded to his classmate,\n",
      "who followed him outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just come along, and say nothing about the matter on the street,\"\n",
      "requested Dave. \"It might be overheard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" questioned Hallam wonderingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait and see, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From Chow Hop's wretched establishment it was not far to the other\n",
      "building that Dave had in mind as a destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they arrived, and stood at the foot of the steps, Hallam\n",
      "clutched Darrin's arm, holding him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, see here, this is the police station!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it,\" Dave replied calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But see here, you're not--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to drag you into anything that you'd object to,\" Darrin\n",
      "continued. \"Come along; all I want you for is as a witness to what I am\n",
      "going to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do it, old fel--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought that over, and I feel that I must,\" replied Dave firmly.\n",
      "\"Come along. Don't attract attention by standing here arguing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In another instant the two midshipmen were going swiftly up the steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief of police received his two callers courteously. Dave told the\n",
      "official how their attention had been called to the fact that one of\n",
      "their number was in an opium joint. Dave named the place, but requested\n",
      "the chief to wait a full hour before taking any action.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will give us a chance to get out a comrade who may have committed\n",
      "only his first offense,\" Dave continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's any opium being smoked in that place I'll surely close the\n",
      "joint out!\" replied the chief, bringing his fist down upon his desk.\n",
      "\"But I understand your reasons, Mr.--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darrin is my name, sir,\" replied Dave quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, Mr. Darrin, I give you my word that I won't even start my\n",
      "investigations before this evening. And I'll keep all quiet about the\n",
      "midshipman end of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Dave gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the two midshipmen strolled slowly back in the direction of Chow\n",
      "Hop's, Dave murmured:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, you see why I took this step?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid not very clearly,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That scoundrelly Chow made his boast that other midshipmen patronized\n",
      "his place. I don't believe it. Such a vice wouldn't appeal to you, and\n",
      "it doesn't to me. But there are more than two hundred new plebes coming\n",
      "in just now, and many of these boys have never been away from home\n",
      "before. Some of them might foolishly seek the lure of a new vice, and\n",
      "might find the habit fastened on them before they were aware of it.\n",
      "Chow's vile den might spoil some good material for the quarter-deck,\n",
      "and, as a matter of midshipman honor, we're bound to see that the place\n",
      "is cleaned out right away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess, Darry, you come pretty near being right,\" assented Hallam,\n",
      "after thinking for a few moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time they reached Chow Hop's again they found that Dr. Lawrence\n",
      "had brought the unfortunate Pennington to. And a very scared and\n",
      "humiliated midshipman it was who now stood up, a bit unsteadily, and\n",
      "tried to smooth down his uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you feel now?\" asked Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful!\" shuddered Pennington. \"And now see here, what are you fellows\n",
      "going to do? Blab, and see me driven out of the Navy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do any talking in here,\" advised Dave, with a meaning look over\n",
      "his shoulder at the yellow men in the outer room. \"Doctor, is our friend\n",
      "in shape to walk along with us now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will be, in two or three minutes, after he drinks something I'm\n",
      "going to give him,\" replied the medical man, shaking a few drops from\n",
      "each of three vials into a glass of water. \"Here, young man, drink this\n",
      "slowly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three minutes later the midshipmen left the place, Dave walking beside\n",
      "Pennington and holding his arm lightly for the purpose of steadying him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did this happen, Pen?\" queried Dave, when the six men of the third\n",
      "class at last found themselves walking down Maryland Avenue. \"How long\n",
      "have you been at this 'hop' trick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never before to-day,\" replied Midshipman Pennington quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pen, will you tell me that on your honor?\" asked Dave gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other midshipman flared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why must I give you my word of honor?\" he demanded defiantly. \"Isn't my\n",
      "plain word good enough?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your word of honor that you had never smoked opium before to-day would\n",
      "help to ease my mind a whole lot,\" replied Darrin. \"Come, unburden\n",
      "yourself, won't you, Pen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you, Darry, just how it happened. To-day _was_ the first\n",
      "time, on my word of honor, I came out into Annapolis with a raging\n",
      "toothache. Now, you know how a fellow gets to hate to go before the\n",
      "medical officers of the Academy with a tale about his teeth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" nodded Darrin. \"If a fellow is too much on the medical\n",
      "report for trouble with his teeth, then it makes the surgeons look his\n",
      "mouth over with all the more caution, and in the end a fellow may get\n",
      "dropped from the brigade just because he has invited over zeal from the\n",
      "dentist. But what has all this to do with opium smoking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just this,\" replied Pennington, hanging his head. \"I went into a drug\n",
      "store and asked a clerk that I know what was the best thing for\n",
      "toothache. He told me the best he knew was to smoke a pipe of opium, and\n",
      "told me where to find Chow Hop, and what to say to the chink. And it's\n",
      "all a lie about opium helping a sore tooth,\" cried the wretched\n",
      "midshipman, clapping a hand to his jaw, \"for there goes that fiendish\n",
      "tooth again! But say! You fellows are not going to leak about my little\n",
      "mishap?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Darrin with great promptness. \"You're going to do that\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" gasped Midshipman Pennington in intense astonishment. \"What are\n",
      "you talking about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll be wise to turn in a report, on what happened,\" pursued Dave,\n",
      "\"for it's likely to reach official ears, anyway, and you'll be better\n",
      "off if you make the first report on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is it likely to reach official ears, if you fellows keep your\n",
      "mouths shut?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see,\" Darrin went on very quietly, \"I reported the joint at the\n",
      "police station, and Chow Hop threatened that, if I did, he'd tell all\n",
      "he knew about everybody. So you'd better be first----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You broke the game out to the police!\" gasped Pennington, staring\n",
      "dumfoundedly at his comrade. \"What on earth----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did it because I had more than one satisfactory reason for\n",
      "considering it my duty,\" interposed Dave, speaking quietly though\n",
      "firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--you--bag of wind!\" exploded Midshipman Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll accept your apology when you've had time to think it all over,\"\n",
      "replied Dave, with a smile, though there was a brief flash in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make no apology to you--at any time, you--you--greaser!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marks for efficiency or good conduct, which increase a midshipman's\n",
      "standing, are called \"grease-marks\" or \"grease\" in midshipman slang.\n",
      "Hence a midshipman who is accused of currying favor with his officers in\n",
      "order to win \"grease\" is contemptuously termed a \"greaser.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to talk with you any more, Mr. Darrin,\" Pennington went on\n",
      "bitterly, \"or walk with you, either. When I get over this toothache I'll\n",
      "call you out--you greaser!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning with indignation, Midshipman Pennington fell back to walk with\n",

      "\n",
      "DAVE'S PAP-SHEET ADVICE\n",
      "\n",
      "When our party reached the landing a lively scene lay before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fully a hundred midshipmen, belonging to the first, second and third\n",
      "classes, were waiting to be transported out to one or another of the\n",
      "great, gray battleships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several launches were darting back and forth over the water. The baggage\n",
      "of the midshipmen had already been taken aboard the battleships. Only\n",
      "the young men themselves were now awaited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near-by stood a lieutenant of the Navy, who was directing the\n",
      "embarkation of the midshipmen of the different classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes after our party arrived a launch from the \"Massachusetts\"\n",
      "lay in alongside the landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Third classmen, this way!\" shouted the lieutenant. \"How many of you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning his eyes over the squad that had moved forward, the officer\n",
      "continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twenty-two. You can all crowd into this launch. Move quickly, young\n",
      "gentlemen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In another couple of minutes the puffing launch was steaming away to\n",
      "the massive battleship that lay out in the stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave stood well up in the bow. Once he barely overheard Pennington\n",
      "mutter to a comrade:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The rascally greaser!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That means me,\" Dave muttered under his breath. \"I won't take it up\n",
      "now, or in any hurry. I'll wait until Pen has had time to see things\n",
      "straight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the launch lay alongside, the young midshipmen clambered\n",
      "nimbly up the side gangway, each raising his cap to the flag at the\n",
      "stern as he passed through the opening in the rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here stood an officer with an open book in his hand. To him each\n",
      "midshipman reported, saluting, stated his name, and received his\n",
      "berthing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry away to find your berthings, and get acquainted with the\n",
      "location,\" ordered this officer. \"Every midshipman will report on the\n",
      "quarter-deck promptly at five p.m. In the meantime, after locating your\n",
      "berthings, you are at liberty to range over the ship, avoiding the ward\n",
      "room and the staterooms of officers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest arrivals saluted. Then, under the guidance of messengers\n",
      "chosen from among the apprentice members of the crew, the young men\n",
      "located their berthings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to get mine changed, if I can,\" growled Pennington, wheeling\n",
      "upon Dave Darrin. \"I'm much too close to a greaser. I'm afraid I may get\n",
      "my uniforms spotted, as well as my character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop that, Pen!\" warned Dave, stationing himself squarely before the\n",
      "angry Pennington. \"I don't know just how far you're responsible for what\n",
      "you're saying now. To-morrow, if you make any such remarks to me, you'll\n",
      "have to pay a mighty big penalty for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll make me pay by going to the commandant and telling him all you\n",
      "know, I suppose?\" sneered Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know better, Pen! Now, begin to practise keeping a civil tongue\n",
      "behind your teeth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, Darrin turned on his heel, seeking the deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "This left \"Pen\" to conjecture as to whether he should report his\n",
      "misadventure, and, if so, how best to go about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Hallam,\" began the worried midshipman, \"I begin to feel that\n",
      "it will be safer to turn in some kind of report on myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much safer,\" agreed Hallam. \"It will show good faith on your part if\n",
      "you report yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And get me broken from the service, too, I suppose,\" growled the\n",
      "unhappy one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly think it will, if you report yourself first,\" urged Hallam.\n",
      "\"But you'll be about certain to get your walking papers if you wait for\n",
      "the first information to come from other sources.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang it,\" groaned Pennington, \"I wish I could think, but my head aches\n",
      "as though it would split and my tooth is putting up more trouble than I\n",
      "ever knew there was in the world. And, in this racked condition, I'm to\n",
      "go and put myself on the pap-sheet. In what way shall I do it, Hallam?\n",
      "Can't you suggest something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" retorted Hallam with great energy. \"Go to the medical officer and\n",
      "tell him how your tooth troubles you. Tell him what you tried on shore.\n",
      "I'll go with you, if you want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you, old man? I'll be a thousand times obliged!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the pair went off in search of the sick-bay, as the hospital part of\n",
      "a battleship is called. The surgeon was not in his office adjoining, but\n",
      "the hospital steward called him over one of the ship telephones,\n",
      "informing him that a midshipman was suffering with an ulcerated tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Mackenzie came at once, turned on a reflector light, and gazed into\n",
      "Midshipman Pennington's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you tried to treat this tooth yourself, in any way?\" queried the\n",
      "ship's surgeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; I was so crazy with the pain, while in Annapolis, that I am\n",
      "afraid I did something that will get me into trouble,\" replied\n",
      "Pennington, with a quiver in his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was that?\" asked Dr. Mackenzie, glancing at him sharply. \"Did you\n",
      "try the aid of liquor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse, I'm afraid, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington told of his experience with the opium pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's no good whatever for a toothache, sir,\" growled Dr. Mackenzie.\n",
      "\"Besides, it's a serious breach of discipline. I shall have to report\n",
      "you, Mr. Pennington.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I expected it, sir,\" replied Pennington meekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, the report won't cure your toothache,\" continued Dr. Mackenzie\n",
      "in a milder tone. \"We'll attend to that first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgeon busied himself with dissolving a drug in a small quantity of\n",
      "water. This he took up in a hypodermic needle and injected into the\n",
      "lower jaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ache ought to stop in ten minutes, sir,\" continued the surgeon,\n",
      "turning to enter some memoranda in his record book.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that the surgeon called up the ship's commander over the 'phone,\n",
      "and made known Pennington's report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, Captain Scott directs that you report at his office\n",
      "immediately,\" said the surgeon, as he turned away from the telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both midshipmen saluted, then left the sick-bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is where you have to go up alone, I guess,\" hinted Midshipman\n",
      "Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid so,\" sighed Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, I'll be on the quarter-deck, and, if I'm wanted, you can send\n",
      "there for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, old man. You're worth a brigade of Darrins--confound the\n",
      "greasing meddler!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darrin acted according to his best lights on the subject of duty,\"\n",
      "remonstrated Mr. Hallam mildly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His best lights--bah!\" snarled Pennington. \"I'll take this all out of\n",
      "him before I'm through with him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington reported to the battleship's commander. After some ten\n",
      "minutes a marine orderly found Hallam and directed him to go to Captain\n",
      "Scott's office. Here Hallam repeated as much as was asked of him\n",
      "concerning the doings of the afternoon. Incidentally, the fact of\n",
      "Midshipman Darrin's report to the police was brought out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I shall send you at once, in a launch, over to the\n",
      "commandant of cadets to report this matter in person to him,\" said\n",
      "Captain Scott gravely. \"Mr. Hallam, you will go with Mr. Pennington.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, after the two had departed, an apprentice messenger went through\n",
      "the ship calling Dave's name. That young man was summoned to Captain\n",
      "Scott's office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in possession of all the facts relating to the unfortunate affair\n",
      "of Midshipman Pennington, Mr. Darrin,\" began Captain Scott, after the\n",
      "interchange of salutes. \"Will you tell me why you reported the affair to\n",
      "the police?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went to the police, sir,\" Dave replied, \"because I was aware that\n",
      "many members of the new fourth class are away from home for the first\n",
      "time in their lives. I was afraid, sir, that possibly some of the new\n",
      "midshipmen might, during one of their town-leaves, be tempted to try for\n",
      "a new experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very excellent reason, Mr. Darrin, and I commend you heartily for it.\n",
      "I shall also report your exemplary conduct to the commandant of\n",
      "midshipmen. You have, in my opinion, Mr. Darrin, displayed very good\n",

      "But I am afraid,\" continued the Navy captain dryly, \"that you have done\n",
      "something that will make you highly unpopular, for a while, with some\n",
      "of the members of your class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not, sir,\" replied Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I,\" smiled Captain Scott \"I am willing to find myself a poor\n",
      "prophet. That is all, Mr. Darrin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more saluting, Dave left the commanding officer's presence. Almost\n",
      "the first classmate into whom he stumbled was Dan Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, from what quarter does the wind blow!\" murmured Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin repeated the interview that he had just had.\n",

      "\"I'm afraid, Dave, little giant, that you've planted something of a mine\n",
      "under yourself,\" murmured Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel as much convinced as ever, Danny boy, that I did just what I\n",
      "should have done,\" replied Darrin seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so does Captain Scott, and so will the commandant,\" replied Dan.\n",
      "\"But winning the commendation of your superior officers doesn't always\n",
      "imply that you'll get much praise from your classmates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, you are quite right,\" smiled Dave. \"Still, I'd do the\n",
      "same thing over again.\"\n",

      "\"Oh, of course you would,\" assented Dan. \"That's because you're Dave\n",

      "This order was repeated in other parts of the ship. Midshipmen gathered\n",

      "soon as the third classmen, or \"youngsters,\" as they are called in\n",
      "midshipman parlance, had formed, the orders were read off dividing them\n",
      "into sections for practical instruction aboard ship during the cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave's name was one of the first read off. He was assigned to duty as\n",

      "The same section was also designated for steam instruction, Dalzell\n",
      "being made leader of the section in this branch.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Darry, old man,\" murmured Hallam, \"Pen is as crazy as a hornet against\n",
      "you. As he had taken the first step by sticking himself on the pap-sheet\n",
      "(placing himself on report), the commandant said he would make the\n",
      "punishment a lighter one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did Pen get?\" queried Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifty demerits, with all the loss of privileges that fifty carry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's lucky,\" declared Dave promptly. \"Had the report come from other\n",
      "sources, he would have been dismissed from the service.\"\n",

      "and ignorant handling of a switch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's pretty cheeky for an enlisted man to talk to midshipmen about\n",
      "ignorance,\" whispered Pennington to Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know--\" Farley started to reply, but Darrin's quiet voice\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Cease talking in section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farley knew this to be a merited rebuke, and accepted it as such, but\n",

      "\n",
      "That morning none of the midshipmen were called upon to handle any of\n",
      "the fascinating-looking machinery. Nearly the whole of this tour of\n",
      "practical instruction was taken up by the remarks of the chief\n",
      "electrician. As he spoke, Whittam moved over to one piece or another of\n",
      "mechanism and explained its uses. Finally, he began to question the\n",
      "attentive young men, to see how much of his instruction they had\n",
      "absorbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a shame, to set an enlisted man up over us as quiz-master, just\n",

      "reconsidered and drew back his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, the temptation proved too strong. He slid one hand\n",
      "along the rail.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The fellow has no right to talk to a midshipman in that fashion!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "It is only just to Pennington to state that he actually believed he had\n",

      "\n",
      "Descending lower into the ship, the chief engineer led the young middies\n",
      "over a grating, and paused at the head of an iron ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass down in orderly fashion, single file,\" directed the chief\n",

      "\n",
      "Just as they were near the bottom Dave felt a foot descend upon his\n",
      "shoulder, almost with a kick, and then rest there with a crushing\n",
      "pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It hurt keenly until Darrin was able to dodge out from under and\n",
      "hurriedly reach the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon, whoever you are,\" came a gruff voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave, with his shoulder crippled a good deal, and paining keenly, halted\n",
      "as soon as his foot had touched bottom. It was dark down there, though\n",
      "some reflected light came from an incandescent light at a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave waited, to peer into the face of the man who had stepped on his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",

      "Pennington, with apparent curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't you know it!\" questioned Darrin, looking straight into the\n",
      "other's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of answering intelligibly, Pennington turned and walked away a\n",
      "few feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps that fellow thinks he's going to vent his spite on me in a lot\n",

      "narrow passage, only a few feet long, and came out in the furnace room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here huge fires glowed through the furnace doors. Four of the Navy's\n",
      "firemen stood resting on their shovels. Instantly, on perceiving the\n",
      "chief engineer, however, the men stood at attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass the word for the chief water tender,\" ordered the engineer,\n",
      "turning to one of the firemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The messenger soon came back with a pleasant-faced, stalwart man of\n",
      "forty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heistand,\" ordered the chief engineer, \"give these members of the first\n",

      "kind, the chief engineer turned and left the furnace room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heistand was presumably of German parentage, though he had no accent. He\n",
      "struck the midshipmen as being a pleasant, wholesome fellow, though the\n",
      "water tenders and firemen of the \"Massachusetts\" knew that he could be\n",
      "extremely strict and grim at need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will now, young gentlemen,\" began Heistand, \"proceed to learn all\n",
      "about priming a furnace, lighting, building, cleaning and generally\n",
      "taking care of a fire. Two furnaces have been left idle for this\n",
      "instruction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But two of the regular firemen now remained in the room. These were\n",
      "ordered to hustle out coal before boilers B and D. Then Heistand taught\n",
      "the members of the section how to swing a shovel to the best advantage\n",
      "so as to get in a maximum of coal with the least effort. He also\n",
      "illustrated two or three incorrect ways of shoveling coal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea of making coal heavers out of us!\" growled a much-disgusted\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan did not see who the speaker was, but his eyes flashed as he turned\n",
      "and rasped out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silence in the section! Speak only to ask for information, and then at\n",
      "the proper time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another young autocrat!\" muttered a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait one moment, please, Heistand,\" begged Dan. Then, wheeling squarely\n",
      "about, and facing all the members of the section, he declared with\n",
      "emphasis:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's any more unauthorized talking I shall feel obliged to pass\n",
      "the word above that discipline is in a bad way in this section.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he wheeled about once more, facing the chief water tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, young gentlemen,\" resumed the chief water tender, \"take your\n",
      "shovels and fill in lively under boilers B and D.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three or four times Heistand checked one or another of the midshipmen,\n",
      "to show him a more correct way of handling the shovel. Yet, in good\n",
      "time, both furnaces were primed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Dalzell, please detail four members of the section to follow\n",
      "me with their shovels and bring red coals from under another boiler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan appointed himself, Darrin, Farley and Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning coals were brought and thrown into each furnace, and in a little\n",
      "while roaring fires were going. These, though not needed for the\n",
      "handling of the battleship, were permitted to burn for a while,\n",
      "Heistand explaining to the section practically the uses of the water\n",
      "gauges and the test cocks. By this time the midshipmen's white working\n",
      "clothes were liberally sprinkled with coal dust and somewhat smeared\n",
      "with oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, young gentlemen, as we have no further use for these fires,\n",
      "you will next learn how to haul them,\" announced Heistand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was interesting work, but hot and fast. The implements with which\n",
      "the middies worked soon became red-hot at the end. Yet, as all entered\n",
      "into this novel work with zest, the fires had soon been hauled out on to\n",
      "the floor plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the last of this work was being done Pennington, as an apparent\n",
      "accident due to excess of zeal, dropped the red-hot end of his implement\n",
      "across the toe of Darrin's left shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant the leather began to blaze. With swift presence of mind\n",
      "Dave stepped his right foot on the flame, smothering it at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was \"mad clean through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Pen,\" he muttered, in a low voice, his eyes blazing fiercely\n",
      "into the other midshipman's, \"that is the last piece of impudence that\n",
      "will be tolerated from you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Midshipman Pennington's lip curled disdainfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan had not seen the \"accident,\" but he was near enough to hear the\n",

      "\"Mr. Darrin, you will place yourself on report for unauthorized talking\n",
      "in section!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "far forget yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A something that would have had the same effect on you,\" retorted Dave\n",
      "grimly. Thereupon he described Pennington's two underhanded assaults\n",
      "that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humph!\" muttered Dalzell. \"That fellow Pen is bound to go the whole\n",

      "\"He won't go much further,\" declared Dave, his eyes flashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the chump ought to know it, too,\" mused Dan. \"The class history of\n",
      "the last year should have taught him that. But see here, Dave, I don't\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I wish an understanding with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want any with you,\" replied Pennington insolently, as he stared\n",

      "sprang squarely in front of him.\n",
      "\n",

      "think you have to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have two things to speak about,\" replied Dave, trying to control his\n",
      "voice. \"In the first place, while going down the ladders to the furnaces\n",
      "this morning, you stepped on my shoulder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" insisted Pennington coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The second thing you did was, when hauling the fires, to drop red-hot\n",
      "metal across one of my shoes, setting it on fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" insisted Pennington more coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean to contend that either one was an accident,\" resumed Dave,\n",
      "\"then--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found himself obliged to pause for a moment in order to steady\n",
      "his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" asked Pennington with more insolence than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you make such pretense in either case,\" tittered Dave Darrin, \"then\n",

      "\"Fellow!\" sputtered Pennington, turning white with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean what I say, and I can back it up,\" muttered Darrin.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, nearly all, anyway. You see, I've known and observed Darrin for a\n",

      "any trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did he?\" gasped Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he qualified the statement, but his way of saying it was as\n",
      "offensive as the direct lie could have been.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, Penny; it's you that I'm concerned about in my own mind. You're\n",
      "going next to a very hard proposition. Darry is patient--almost as\n",
      "patient as the proverbial camel--but when he fights he fights! You'll be\n",
      "hammered to a pulp, Pen.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but you're a mile bigger and heavier, and you're spry, too. You\n",
      "ought to handle him with all the ease in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dave's very success, however, made his opponent all the angrier. From\n",
      "annoyance, followed by excessive irritation, Pennington went into almost\n",

      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Dave swung his right in on the point of Pen's chin with a force\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now I know how that fellow Darrin wins his fights,\" growled Pennington\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Pennington, at last, managed to deliver one blow on Darrin's right\n",
      "short ribs. It took a lot of Dave's spare wind; he raced about, seeking\n",
      "to regain his wind before allowing close quarters. But at last\n",
      "Pennington closed in again, and, after a swift feint, tried to land the\n",
      "same short-rib blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin was watching, and blocked. Then, his temples reddening with\n",

      "ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time!\" shouted Dawley, just as Pen went to the floor in a heap. That\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, suddenly, Darrin seemed to change not only his tactics, but his\n",
      "whole personality. To his opponent Dave seemed suddenly transformed into\n",
      "a dancing demon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about the same old footwork, but it was aggressive now, instead\n",
      "of being defensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, Dave landed a light tap on the already suffering nose. A few\n",
      "seconds later he landed on the point of Pen's chin, though not hard\n",
      "enough to send his man down. Then a rather light blow on the jaw, just\n",
      "under Pen's right ear again. The larger midshipman was now thoroughly\n",
      "alarmed. He feared that Darrin could do whatever he willed, and shivered\n",
      "with wonder as to when the knockout blow would come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, Pennington was still putting up a better battle than he\n",
      "himself realized, and Darrin was not disposed to take any foolish\n",
      "chances through rushing the affair. Thus, the third round ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that they came up for the fourth round, after both men had\n",

      "\n",
      "Dave's tactics were the same in the fourth round. Pennington didn't find\n",

      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first minute no important blows were landed on either side.\n",
      "Then, suddenly, Dave darted in and under, and brought a right-arm hook\n",
      "against Pen's nose in a way that started that member to bleeding again,\n",
      "and with a steady flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "That jarred the larger midshipman. He plunged in, heavily and blindly,\n",

      "Dave took a fair get away, not attempting to strike as the clinch was\n",
      "broken. But an instant later Dave came back, dancing all around his\n",

      "either ear and finally on the tip of the chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pen was sure that none of these blows had been delivered with the force\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Time!\" shouted Midshipman Dawley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principals retired to their corners, Pennington almost wholly afraid\n",
      "from the conviction that his antagonist was now merely playing with him\n",
      "to keep the interest going.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Pennington was still rather badly scared when the two came together\n",
      "for the fifth round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get lively, now, gentlemen, if you can,\" begged Referee Remington.\n",
      "\"Finish this one way or the other, and let us get some of the benefits\n",
      "of our shore leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pen started by putting more steam behind every blow. Dave, who had used\n",
      "up so much of his wind by his brilliant footwork, began to find it\n",
      "harder to keep the upper hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice, however, he managed to land body blows. He was trying to drive in\n",
      "a third when Pennington blocked, following this with a left-arm jab on\n",
      "Darrin's left jaw that sent the lighter man to the floor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"--seven, eight, nine, te----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave was up on his feet. Pen tried to make a quick rush, but Darrin\n",
      "dodged cleverly, them wheeled and faced his opponent as the latter\n",
      "wheeled about.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that there was less footwork. Both men stood up to it, as keenly\n",
      "alert as they could be, each trying to drive home heavy blows. While\n",
      "they were still at it the call of time sounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let him put it over you, David, little giant!\" warned Dan, as the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I tried to get him,\" muttered Dave in an undertone, \"and I shall go on\n",
      "trying to the last. But Pennington is pretty nearly superior to anyone\n",
      "in my class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just waltz in and show him,\" whispered Dalzell, as the call sounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington entered the sixth round with more confidence. He began, at\n",
      "the outset, to drive in heavy blows, nor did Dave do much dodging.\n",

      "jaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down went the larger midshipman again. This time he moaned. His eyes\n",
      "were open, though they had a somewhat glassy look in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawley was counting off the seconds in measured tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"--seven, eight, nine--ten!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "despair and rage.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As the two officials of the meeting hustled out of the barn, Dalzell\n",

      "sprayed, then rubbed Dave's chest and arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe, but I'm not so sure of that,\" rejoined Darrin. \"That fellow\n",

      "\n",
      "From Hampton Roads the Battleship Squadron, with the midshipmen on\n",
      "board, sailed directly for Plymouth, England.\n",
      "\n",
      "During most of the voyage over slow cruising speed was used. By the time\n",
      "that England's coast was sighted the third-class middies found they knew\n",
      "much more about a battleship than they had believed to be possible at\n",
      "the start of the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had served as firemen; they had mastered many of the electrical\n",
      "details of a battleship; they had received instruction and had \"stood\n",
      "trick\" by the engines; there had been some drill with the smaller,\n",
      "rapid-fire guns, and finally, they had learned at least the rudiments of\n",
      "\"wig-wagging,\" as signaling by means of signal flags is termed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just before the call to supper formation when England's coast\n",
      "loomed up. Most of the midshipmen stood at the rail, watching eagerly\n",
      "for a better glimpse at the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the midshipmen, especially those who came from wealthier\n",
      "families, had been in England before entering the Naval Academy. These\n",
      "fortunate ones were questioned eagerly by their comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battleships were well in sight of Eastern King Point when the\n",
      "midshipmen's call for supper formation sounded. Feeling that they would\n",
      "much have preferred to wait for their supper, the young men hastened\n",
      "below.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the line was formed it seemed to the impatient young men as though\n",
      "it had never taken so long to read the orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there came one welcome order, to the effect that, immediately after\n",
      "the morning meal, all midshipmen might go to the pay officer and draw\n",
      "ten dollars, to be charged against their pay accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ten dollars apiece looms up large David, little giant,\" murmured\n",
      "Dan Dalzell, while the evening meal was in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We ought to have a lot of fun on it,\" replied Darrin, who was looking\n",
      "forward with greatest eagerness to his first visit to any foreign soil.\n",
      "\"But how much shore leave are we to have?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two days, the word is. We'll get it straight in the morning, at\n",
      "breakfast formation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In defiance of regulations, Midshipman Pennington, whose father was\n",
      "wealthy, had several hundred dollars concealed in his baggage. He had\n",
      "already invited Hallam, Mossworth and Dickey to keep in his wake on\n",
      "shore, and these young men had gladly enough agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, but we're slackening speed!\" quivered Dalzell, when the meal was\n",
      "nearly finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Headway has stopped,\" declared Darrin a few moments later.\n",

      "Three times this was done, each time the lips of the midshipmen forming\n",
      "a silent cheer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Boom! sounded sharply overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There goes the twenty-one-gunner,\" announced Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a foreign battleship enters a fortified port the visiting fleet, or\n",
      "rather, its flagship, fires a national salute of twenty-one guns. After\n",
      "a short interval following the discharge of the last gun, one of the\n",
      "forts on shore answers with twenty-one guns. This is one of the methods\n",
      "of observing the courtesies between nations by their respective fleets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere all the guns had been fired from the flagship, the third classmen\n",
      "received the rising signal; the class marched out and was dismissed.\n",
      "Instantly a break was made for deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The midshipmen were in good time to see the smoke and hear the roar of\n",
      "guns from one of the forts on shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning the commandant of cadets, as commanding officer of the\n",
      "squadron, would go ashore with his aide and pay a formal call to the\n",
      "senior military officer. Later in the day that English officer and one\n",
      "or two of his staff officers would return the call by coming out to the\n",
      "flagship. That accomplished, all the required courtesies would have been\n",
      "observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was still broad daylight, for in summer the English twilight is a\n",
      "long one, and darkness does not settle down until late.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if we were only going ashore to-night!\" murmured Hallam. There were\n",
      "many others to echo the thought, but all knew that it could not be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't we find a trick for slipping ashore after lights out?\"\n",
      "eagerly queried Dickey, who was not noted as a \"greaser.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could we?\" quivered Hallam, who, with few demerits against him, felt\n",
      "inclined to take a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Pennington, to whom he appealed, shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too big a risk, Hally,\" replied Pen. \"And trebly dangerous, with that\n",
      "greaser, Darrin, in the class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stow that,\" growled Hallam. \"Darrin is no greaser. You've got him\n",
      "on your black books--that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a greaser, I tell you,\" cried Pennington fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a score of midshipmen in this group, and many of them nodded\n",
      "approvingly at Pennington's statement. Though still a class leader, Dave\n",
      "had lost some of his popularity since his report to the police of\n",
      "Annapolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the middies turned in, that night, with unsatisfied dreams of shore\n",
      "life in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after breakfast the next morning, however, every midshipman had\n",
      "drawn his ten dollars, even to Pennington, who had no use for such a\n",
      "trifling amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "As fast as possible the launches ranged alongside at the side gangway,\n",
      "taking off groups of midshipmen, everyone of whom had been cautioned to\n",
      "be at dock in time to board a launch in season for supper formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington and his party were among the first to land. They hurried\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the second trip of one of the launches that Dave, Dan and\n",
      "Farley made their get away. These three chums had agreed to stick\n",
      "together during the day. They landed at the Great Western Docks, to find\n",
      "themselves surrounded by eager British cabbies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are we going to take a cab and get more quickly and intelligently to\n",
      "the best part of the town to see?\" asked Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't vote for it,\" replied Darrin. \"We have only five dollars apiece\n",
      "for each of the two days we're to be ashore. I move that we put in the\n",
      "forenoon, anyway, in prowling about the town for ourselves. We'll learn\n",
      "more than we would by riding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, then,\" approved Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plymouth is an old-fashioned English seaport that has been rather famous\n",
      "ever since the thirteenth century. Many parts of the town, including\n",
      "whole streets, look as though the houses had been built since that time.\n",
      "This is especially true of many of the streets near the water front.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two hours the three middies roamed through the streets, often\n",
      "meeting fellow classmen. Wherever the young midshipmen went many of the\n",
      "English workmen and shopkeepers raised their hats in friendly salute of\n",
      "the American uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't seem to run across Pen's gang anywhere,\" remarked Farley at\n",
      "last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" smiled Dave. \"That's a capitalistic crowd. They'll hit only\n",
      "the high spots.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, these three poor-in-purse midshipmen enjoyed themselves\n",
      "hugely in seeing the quaint old town. At noon they found a real old\n",
      "English chop house, where they enjoyed a famous meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish we could slip some of these little mutton pies back with us!\"\n",
      "sighed Dan wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon the three chums saw the newer market place, where all\n",
      "three bought small souvenirs for their mothers at home. Darrin also\n",
      "secured a little remembrance present for his sweetheart, Belle Meade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guild hall and some of the other famous buildings were visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the afternoon Dave began to inspect his watch every two or\n",
      "three minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No need for us to worry, with Dave's eye glued to his watch,\" laughed\n",
      "Dan.\n",

      "\"Come on, fellows,\" summoned Darrin finally. \"We haven't more than time\n",
      "now to make the dock and get back to supper formation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take a cab?\" asked Farley. \"You know, we've found that they're vastly\n",
      "cheaper than American cabs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No-o-o, not for me,\" decided Dave. \"We'll need the rest of our shore\n",
      "money to-morrow, and our legs are good and sturdy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even careful Dave, as it turned out, had allowed no more than time.\n",
      "The chums reached the dock in time to see the launches half way between\n",

      "\n",
      "In his most seamanlike style the Briton ranged alongside. Dave tried to\n",
      "press the fare upon the skipper, but he would have none of that. So the\n",
      "three shook hands swiftly but heartily with him, then sprang across to\n",
      "the side gangway, where they paused long enough to lift their caps to\n",

      "\n",
      "Modest Mr. Farley did not mention the fact that he was running toward\n",
      "the stern, intent on following his chums into the rough sea at the very\n",
      "instant when the order reached him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, however, paused for no more information. He was now running\n",
      "forward to take the bridge beside the watch officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The midshipmen, too, hurried forward, mingling with the crew, as the big\n",
      "battleship swung around and tried to find her wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flagship had crowded on extra steam, and was fast coming over the\n",
      "seas.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a sea running, it was well nigh impossible to make out so\n",
      "small a thing as a head or a life-preserver, unless it could be observed\n",
      "at the instant when it crested a wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marine glasses were in use by every officer who had brought his pair to\n",
      "the deck. Others rushed back to their cabins to get them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lieutenant of the marine corps stood forward, close to a big group of\n",
      "sorrowing midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are certain to be three vacancies in the Naval Academy,\" remarked\n",
      "the lieutenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't say that, sir,\" begged Farley, in a choking voice. \"The three\n",
      "overboard are among the finest fellows in the brigade!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to discourage any of you young gentlemen,\" continued the\n",
      "marine corps lieutenant. \"But there's just about one chance in a\n",
      "thousand that we shall be able to sight and pick up any one of the\n",
      "unlucky three. In the first place, it would take a wonderful swimmer to\n",
      "live long in such a furious sea. In the second place, if all three are\n",
      "still swimming, it will be almost out of the question to make out their\n",
      "heads among the huge waves. You've none of you seen a man overboard\n",
      "before in a big sea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of the mute, anxious midshipmen shook their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll realize the difficulties of the situation within the next few\n",
      "minutes,\" remarked the lieutenant. \"I am sorry to crush your hopes for\n",
      "your classmates, but this is all a part of the day's work in the Navy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest steam launches from all three of the battleships were being\n",
      "swiftly lowered. Officers and men were lowered with the launches. As the\n",
      "launch shoved off from each battleship tremendous cheers followed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop all unnecessary noise!\" bellowed the watch officer from the bridge\n",
      "of the \"Massachusetts.\" \"You may drown out calls for help with your\n",
      "racket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the three battleships went back over their courses in more stately\n",
      "fashion, the launches darted here and there, until it seemed as though\n",
      "they must cover every foot within a square mile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how they can help finding the three,\" Farley declared\n",
      "hopefully.\n",

      "Other midshipmen joined in with their protests. When a man is overboard\n",
      "in an angry sea all hands left behind try to be optimists.\n",
      "\n",
      "When fifteen minutes had been spent in the search the onlooking but\n",
      "helpless middies began to look worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of half an hour some of them looked haggard. Farley's face\n",
      "was pitiable to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of an hour of constant but fruitless searching hardly any one\n",
      "felt any hope of a rescue now.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three midshipmen, the \"man overboard\" and his two willing, would-be\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet the hardest blow of all came when, at the end of an hour and a\n",
      "quarter, the flagship signaled the recall of the small boats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, indeed, all hope was given up. In an utter human silence, save for\n",
      "the husky voicing of the necessary orders, the launches were hoisted on\n",
      "board. Then the flagship flew the signal for resuming the voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were few dry eyes among the third class midshipmen when the\n",

      "\n",
      "Dave's spring to the stern rail was all but instantaneous. He was\n",
      "overboard, after his classmate, ere the marine had had time to leap to\n",
      "the life buoys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the corner of one eye Dan Dalzell saw the marine start on the\n",
      "jump, but Dan was overboard, also, too soon to see exactly what the\n",
      "marine sentry was doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both daring midshipmen sank beneath the surface as they struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dan came up, however, his hand struck something solid and he clutched\n",
      "at it. It was one of the life buoys.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he grasped it, and drew his head up a trifle, Dan saw another\n",
      "floating within thirty feet of him. Swimming hard, and pushing, Dan\n",
      "succeeded in reaching the other buoy. He now rested, holding on to both\n",
      "buoys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, where's David, that little giant?\" muttered Dalzell, striving hard\n",
      "to see through the seething waters and over the tops of foam-crested\n",
      "waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes Dan began to feel decidedly nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet Dave can't have gone down, for he's a better swimmer than I am,\"\n",
      "was Dan's consoling thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Dalzell caught sight of another head. He could have cheered, but\n",
      "he expended his breath on something more sensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave!\" he shouted. \"Old Darry! This way! I have the life buoys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, holding to both of them, but kicking frantically with\n",
      "his feet, Dalzell managed slowly to push the buoys toward Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after he had started, Dan did utter a cheer, even though it was\n",
      "checked by an inrush of salt water that nearly strangled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw two heads. Dave Darrin was coming toward him, helping Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind carried the cheer faintly to Dave. He raised his head a little\n",
      "in the water, and caught sight of Dan and the buoys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some three minutes it took the two chums to meet. Dave Darrin was all\n",
      "but exhausted, for Hallam was now unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Darrin clutched at the buoy he tried to shout, though the voice came\n",
      "weakly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Catch hold of Hallam. I'm down and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dan understood, even before he heard. While Dave clutched at one of\n",
      "the life buoys Dalzell shot out an arm, dragging Hallam in to safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it was Darrin who, with both arms, contrived to link the buoys\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the youngsters had a chance to observe the fact that the\n",
      "battleships had put about and were coming back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll soon be all right,\" sighed Dave contentedly, as soon as he could\n",
      "speak. \"There are thirty-five hundred officers, middies and sailors of\n",
      "the American Navy to look after our safety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From where they lay as they hung to the buoys the chums could even see\n",
      "the launches lowered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan, with some of the emergency lashing about the buoy, succeeded, after\n",
      "a good deal of effort, and with some aid from Dave, in passing a cord\n",
      "about Hallam and under the latter's armpits that secured that midshipman\n",
      "to one of the buoys. The next move of the chums was to lash the buoys\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" declared Dave, \"we can't lose. We can hang on and be safe here\n",
      "for hours, if need be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what a thundering long time it takes them to bring the battleships\n",
      "around to get to us!\" murmured Midshipman Dalzell in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be sure not an unnecessary second has been lost,\" rejoined Dave.\n",
      "\"We're learning something practical now about the handling of big\n",

      "\"I wonder if Hally's a goner?\" murmured Dan in an awe-struck voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe it,\" Dave answered promptly. \"Once we get him back\n",
      "aboard ship the medicos will do a little work over him and he'll sit up\n",
      "and want to know if dinner's ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they fell silent, for, with the roar of wind and waters, it was\n",
      "necessary for them to shout when they talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the minutes went by slowly, the two conscious midshipmen found\n",
      "themselves filled with amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dozen times the launches darted by, not far away. It seemed impossible\n",
      "that the keen, restless eyes of the seekers should not discover the\n",
      "imperiled ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such times Dave and Dan shouted with all the power of their lusty\n",
      "young lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternately Dan and Dave tried the effect of rising as far as they could\n",
      "and frantically waving an arm. There was not a cap to wave among the\n",
      "three of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm beginning to feel discouraged,\" grunted Dave in disgust at last.\n",
      "\"They must have spent a full half day already looking for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Merciful powers!\" gasped Dan at last, as they rode half way up the\n",
      "slope of a big wave. \"I just caught sight of the 'recall of boats'\n",
      "flying from the flagship!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" gasped Dave incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I did!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They've failed and have given up the search,\" spoke Dan rather\n",
      "despairingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We may as well face it,\" muttered Dan brokenly. \"They don't believe\n",
      "that any of us has survived, and we've been abandoned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" spoke Dave Darrin very coolly, \"there's nothing left for us but\n",
      "to die like men of the American Navy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems heartless, needless,\" protested Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" broke in Darrin. \"They've done their best. They're convinced that\n",
      "we're lost. And I should think they would be, after all the time they've\n",
      "searched for us--half a day, at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan said nothing, but tugged until he succeeded in bringing his watch up\n",
      "to the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The blamed thing is water-logged,\" he uttered disgustedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hands point to less than half past nine!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My timepiece doesn't call for half past nine, either,\" he announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can it be possible--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; the time has only seemed longer, I reckon,\" observed Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we'll face it like men,\" proposed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" nodded Dan. \"At least, we're going down in the ocean, and\n",
      "we wear the American Naval uniform. If there's any choice in deaths, I\n",
      "guess that's as good and manly a one as we could choose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor old Hally won't know much about it, anyway, I guess,\" remarked\n",
      "Darrin, who seemed unnaturally cool. Possibly he was a bit dazed by the\n",
      "stunning nature of the fate that seemed about to overtake them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe the ships will go by us in their final get-away,\" proposed Dan\n",
      "Dalzell very soberly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if I'm seaman enough to read the compass by what's visible of the\n",
      "sun,\" returned Midshipman Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then there's no help for it,\" answered Dan, choking slightly. \"I wonder\n",
      "if we could do anything for Hallam?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We won't do anything to bring him to, anyway,\" muttered Darrin. \"Under\n",

      "\n",
      "All was now desolation over the angry sea, as the battleships gradually\n",

      "heads above the big waves, and so----\"\n",
      "\n",

      "fellows, I don't mind so much for myself, but it's fearful to think that\n",
      "I've dragged you into the same fate. It's awful! Why couldn't you have\n",
      "left me to my fate?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, I suppose not, but--but--well, I wish I had been left to pay\n",
      "the price of my tomfoolery all alone. It would have served me right. But\n",

      "for a sailor. We'll just take it as it comes, old fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To not one of the trio did it occur to let go of the life buoys and sink\n",
      "as a means of ending misery. In the first place, human instinct holds to\n",

      "Once more came the cheers of encouragement, as the liner, now some\n",

      "command of the launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unable to see for himself, the officer in the launch depended wholly on\n",
      "those masthead signals. So the launch steamed a somewhat zig-zag course\n",
      "over the waves. Yet, at last, it bore down straight upon the midshipmen.\n",

      "Darrin, Dalzell and Hallam now came very near to closing their eyes, to\n",
      "lessen the suspense.\n",

      "What rousing cheers greeted the returning launch, from the decks of the\n",
      "liner, \"Princess Irene\"! When the three midshipmen reached deck and it\n",
      "was learned that they were midshipmen of the United States Navy, the\n",
      "cheering and interest were redoubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the captain and the ship's doctor cut short any attempt at lionizing\n",
      "by rushing the midshipmen to a stateroom containing three berths. Here,\n",
      "under the doctor's orders, the trio were stripped and rubbed down. Then\n",
      "they were rolled into blankets, and hot coffee brought to them in their\n",
      "berths, while their wet clothing was sent below to one of the furnace\n",
      "rooms for hurried drying.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the medical man had examined them, the steamship's captain\n",
      "began to question them.\n",

      "able to sight your squadron before long.\"\n",

      "He hastened out, to give orders to the deck officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that the young midshipmen had been satisfactorily warmed,\n",
      "and their clothing had been dried, the ship's surgeon consented to their\n",
      "dressing. After this they were led to a private cabin where a satisfying\n",
      "meal was served them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" murmured Dan, leaning back, with a contented sigh,\n",

      "us to-day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater speed of the liner enabled her to sight the battleship\n",
      "squadron something more than two hours afterward. Then the nearest\n",
      "vessel of the fleet was steered for directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck officers of the liner sent their heavy overcoats for the use of\n",
      "the midshipmen, who, enveloped in these roomy garments, went out on deck\n",
      "to watch the pursuit of their own comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within another hour it was possible to signal, and from the \"Princess\n",

      "\"Now, watch for excitement on board your own craft,\" smiled the liner's\n",
      "commander, an Englishman.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the liner's signal had been read by the vessels of the\n",

      "to receive her launch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes more the two vessels were close enough. Both stopped\n",
      "headway. One of the big battleship's launches put off and steamed over,\n",
      "rolling and pitching on the waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most carefully indeed the three midshipmen climbed down a rope ladder\n",
      "and were received by an ensign from the \"Massachusetts,\" who next gave\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more the squadron set sail, and now the homeward-bound pennant was\n",

      "\n",
      "On the second night out the wind was blowing a little less than half a\n",
      "gale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness had fallen when Dave, Dan, Farley and several other midshipmen\n",
      "gathered to talk in low tones at the stern rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently all of them wandered away but Dave. He stood close to the\n",

      "one of the rolling waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently, thinking he saw a light astern, he raised himself, peering\n",

      "\n",
      "Another group of restless middies had sauntered up. Pennington, after a\n",
      "swift look at the pacing officer in charge here, and discovering that\n",
      "the officer's back was turned, executed a series of swift cartwheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out, Pen!\" called Midshipman Dwight, in a low, though sharp\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just too late the warning came.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Pen leaped to his feet after the last turn, one of his hands struck\n",
      "Darrin forcefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave swayed, tried to clutch at something, then--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O-o-o-oh!\" rang the first startled chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, instantly, on top of it, came the rousing hail:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man overboard--astern!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farley and Hallam were the first to reach the rail. But Lieutenant\n",
      "Burton was there almost as quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haul back!\" commanded the lieutenant sternly. \"No one go overboard!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That held the middies in check, for in no place, more than in the Navy,\n",
      "are orders orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clack! was the sound that followed the first cry. Like a flash the\n",
      "marine sentry had thrown his rifle to the deck. A single bound carried\n",
      "him to one of the night life buoys. This he released, and hurled far\n",
      "astern.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the night buoy struck the water a long-burning red light was fused by\n",
      "contact. The glow shone out over the waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the \"Massachusetts's\" speed was being slowed rapidly,\n",
      "and a boat's crew stood at quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat put off quickly, guided by the glow of the red signal light on\n",
      "the buoy. Ere the boat reached the buoy the coxswain made out the head\n",
      "and shoulders of a young man above the rim of the floating buoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after the boat lay alongside. Dave, with the coxswain's aid, pulled\n",
      "himself into the small craft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recovering the buoy, the coxswain flashed the red light three times.\n",
      "From the deck of the battleship came a cheering yell sent up from\n",
      "hundreds of throats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, however, while the boat was on its way to the buoy, a\n",
      "pulsing scene had been enacted on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farley went straight up to Midshipman Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" demanded Farley hotly, \"why did you push Mr. Darrin over the\n",

      "\n",
      "Pennington looked at his questioner as one stunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I did push Darrin over,\" admitted Pennington, \"but it was an\n",
      "accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An easily contrived one, wasn't it?\" demanded Midshipman Farley, rather\n",
      "cynically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was pure accident,\" contended Pennington, paling. \"Until it happened\n",
      "I hadn't the least idea in the world that I was going to send Mr. Darrin\n",
      "or anyone else overboard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huh!\" returned Farley dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huh!\" quoth Hallam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan Dalzell uttered not a word, but the gaze of his eyes was fixed\n",
      "angrily on Pennington.\n",
      "\n",
      "That latter midshipman turned as white as a sheet. His hands worked as\n",
      "though he were attempting to clutch at something to hold himself up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely, you fellows don't believe, do you--\" he stammered weakly, then\n",
      "paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thing we did notice, the other day,\" continued Farley briskly, \"was\n",
      "that, when Darrin was rescued from the sea and returned to us, you were\n",
      "about the only member of the class who didn't go up to him and\n",
      "congratulate him on his marvelous escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Pennington, I haven't the patience to talk with you now,\" rejoined\n",
      "Farley, turning on his heel.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the yell started among the midshipmen nearer the rail.\n",
      "Farley, Dan, Hallam and others joined in the yell and rushed to better\n",
      "points of vantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington tried to join in the cheer, but his tongue seemed fixed to\n",
      "the roof of his mouth. He stood clenching and unclenching his hands, his\n",
      "face an ashen gray in his deep humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care what one or two fellows may say,\" groaned Pennington.\n",
      "\"But I don't want the class to think such things of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the most miserable man on board as the small boat came alongside.\n",
      "The boat, occupants and all, was hoisted up to the davits and swung\n",
      "in-board. To the officer of the deck, who stood near-by, Dave turned,\n",
      "with a brisk salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg to report that I've come aboard, sir,\" Darrin uttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And very glad we are of it, Mr. Darrin,\" replied the officer. \"You will\n",
      "go to your locker, change your clothing and then report to the captain,\n",
      "sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With another salute, Dave hastened below, followed by Dan Dalzell, who\n",
      "was intent on attending him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten minutes later Dave appeared at the door of the captain's cabin. Just\n",
      "a few minutes after that he came out on deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "A crowd gathered about him, expressing their congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you all,\" laughed Dave, \"but don't make so much over a middy\n",
      "getting a bath outside of the schedule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To the rear hung Pennington, waiting his chance. At last, as the crowd\n",
      "thinned, Pennington made his way up to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin, I have to apologize for my nonsense, which was the means\n",
      "of pushing you overboard. It was purely accidental, on my honor. I did\n",
      "not even know it was you at the stern, nor did I realize that my antics\n",
      "would result in pushing any one overboard. I trust you will do me the\n",
      "honor of believing my statement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I believe it, Mr. Pennington,\" answered Darrin, opening his\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some,\" continued Pennington, \"who have intimated to me their\n",
      "belief that I did it on purpose. There may be others who half believe or\n",
      "suspect that I might, or would, do such a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" retorted Dave promptly. \"There may be differences,\n",
      "sometimes, between classmates, but there isn't a midshipman in the Navy\n",
      "who would deliberately try to drown a comrade. It's a preposterous\n",
      "insult against midshipman honor. If I hear any one make a charge like\n",
      "that, I'll call him out promptly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of your friends--I won't name them--insisted, or at least let me\n",
      "feel the force of their suspicions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If any of my friends hinted at such a thing, it was done in the heat of\n",
      "the moment,\" replied Dave heartily. \"Why, Mr. Pennington, such an act of\n",
      "dishonor is impossible to a man bred at Annapolis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin fully believed what he said. On the spur of the moment he held\n",
      "out his hand to his enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennington flushed deeply, for a moment, then put out his own hand,\n",
      "giving Dave's a hearty, straightforward grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was the first to imply the charge,\" broke in Farley quickly. \"I\n",
      "withdraw it, and apologize to both of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was more handshaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next few days, while Darry and Pen did not become by any\n",
      "means intimate, they no longer made any effort to avoid each other, but\n",
      "spoke frankly when they met.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining days of the voyage passed uneventfully enough, except for\n",
      "a great amount of hard work that the middies performed as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the twenty-second of August they entered Chesapeake Bay. Once well\n",
      "inside, they came to anchor. There was considerable practice with the\n",
      "sub-caliber and other smaller guns. On the twenty-ninth of August the\n",

      "\"Yes, of course; but what--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our uniforms look very much like theirs,\" declared Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I can't undertake to believe you,\" Belle pouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, anyway, you girls will soon have a chance to see our uniforms.\n",
      "Just as soon as our hops start, this fall, you and Laura will come down\n",
      "and gladden our hearts by letting us drag you, won't you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drag us?\" repeated Belle, much mystified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's middies' slang for escorting a pretty girl to a midshipman\n",
      "hop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have a lot of slang, then, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Considerable,\" admitted Dave readily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, then, is your slang for a pretty girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we call her a queen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a girl who is--who isn't--pretty!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gold brick,\" answered Dave unblushingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gold brick?\" gasped Belle. \"Dear me! 'Dragging a gold brick' to a hop\n",
      "doesn't sound romantic, does it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't,\" Darrin admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet you have invited me--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our class hasn't started in with its course of social compliments\n",
      "yet,\" laughed Dave. \"Please go look in the glass. Or, if you won't\n",
      "believe the glass, then just wait and see how proud Dan and I are if we\n",
      "can lead you and Laura out on the dancing floor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what horrid slang!\" protested Belle. \"The idea of calling a homely\n",
      "girl a gold brick! And I thought you young men received more or less\n",
      "training in being gracious to the weaker sex.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do,\" Dave answered, \"as soon as we can find any use for the\n",
      "accomplishment. Fourth classmen, you know, are considered too young to\n",
      "associate with girls. It's only now, when we've made a start in the\n",
      "third class, that we're to be allowed to attend the hops at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why must you have to have such horrid names for girls who have not\n",
      "been greatly favored in the way of looks? It doesn't sound exactly\n",
      "gallant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, you know,\" laughed Dave, \"we poor, despised, no-account\n",
      "middies must have some sort of sincere language to talk after we get our\n",
      "masks off for the day. I suppose we like the privilege, for a few\n",
      "minutes in each day, of being fresh, like other young folks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your name for 'fresh' down at Annapolis!\" Belle wanted to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Touge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And for being a bit worse than touge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ratey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which did they call you?\" demanded Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave started, then sat up straight, staring at Miss Meade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see that your tongue hasn't lost its old incisiveness,\" he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not among my friends,\" Belle replied lightly. \"But I can't get my mind\n",
      "off that uniform of yours that you didn't bring home. What would have\n",
      "happened to you if you had been bold enough to do it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess I'd have 'frapped the pap,'\" hazarded Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what on earth is 'frapping the pap'?\" gasped Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's a brief way of telling about it when a midshipman gets stuck\n",
      "on the conduct report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to buy a notebook,\" asserted Belle, \"and write down and\n",
      "classify some of this jargon. I'd hate to visit a strange country, like\n",
      "Annapolis, and find I didn't know the language. And, Dave, what sort of\n",
      "place is Annapolis, anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's a suburb of the Naval Academy,\" Dave answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it dreadfully hard to keep one's place in his class there?\" asked\n",
      "Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the average fellow is satisfied if he doesn't 'bust cold,'\" Dave\n",
      "informed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gracious! What sort of explosion is 'busting cold'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that means getting down pretty close to absolute zero in all\n",
      "studies. When a fellow has the hard luck to bust cold the superintendent\n",
      "allows him all his time, thereafter, to go home and look up a more\n",
      "suitable job than one in the Navy. And when a fellow bilges----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" begged Belle. \"Wait!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She fled from the room, to return presently bearing the prettiest hat\n",
      "that Dave ever remembered having seen on her shapely young head. In one\n",
      "hand she carried a dainty parasol that she turned over to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the cruise?\" asked Darrin, rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going out to get that notebook, now. Please don't talk any more\n",
      "'midshipman' to me until I get a chance to set the jargon down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she stood there, such a pretty and wholesome picture, David Darrin\n",
      "thought he never before had seen such a pretty girl, nor one dressed in\n",
      "such exquisite taste. Being a boy, it did not occur to him that Belle\n",
      "Meade had been engaged for weeks in designing this gown and others that\n",
      "she meant to wear during his brief stay at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of?\" asked Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a pity it is that I am doomed to a short life,\" sighed Darrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A short life? What do you mean?\" Belle asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I'm going to be assassinated, the first hop that you attend at the\n",
      "Naval Academy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I'm a gold brick, am I?\" frowned Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--a--gold brick?\" stammered Dave. \"Why, you--oh, go look in the\n",
      "glass!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A committee made up from among the fellows whose names I don't write\n",

      "You can't dance with them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't intend to,\" replied Belle, with a toss of her head. \"I'll\n",
      "accept, as partners, only those who appear to me the handsomest and most\n",
      "distinguished looking of the midshipmen. No one else can write his name\n",

      "\"Oh!\" cried Belle, dramatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "She moved toward the door. Dave, who could not take his eyes from her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Belle, there's something--\" he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious! Where? What?\" she cried, looking about her keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's something I want to say--must say,\" Dave went on with more of an\n",
      "effort than anyone but himself could guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, as we're going down the street,\" invited Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Wha-a-at?_\" choked Dave. \"Well, I guess not!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He faced her, resting both hands lightly on her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle, we were pretty near sweethearts in the High School, I think,\" he\n",
      "went on, huskily, but looking her straight in the eyes. \"At least, that\n",
      "was my hope, and I hope, most earnestly, that it's going to continue.\n",
      "Belle, I am a long way from my real career, yet. It will be five years,\n",
      "yet, before I have any right to marry. But I want to look forward, all\n",
      "the time, to the sweet belief that my schoolgirl sweetheart is going to\n",
      "become my wife one of these days. I want that as a goal to work for,\n",
      "along with my commission in the Navy. But to this much I agree: if you\n",
      "say 'yes' now, and find later that you have made a mistake, you will\n",
      "tell me so frankly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor boy!\" murmured Belle, looking at him fully. \"You've been a plebe\n",
      "until lately, and you haven't been allowed to see any girls. I'm not\n",
      "going to take advantage of you as heartlessly as that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet something in her eyes gave the midshipman hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle,\" he continued eagerly, \"don't trifle with me. Tell me--will you\n",
      "marry me some day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a little more talk and--well, it's no one's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we're not so formally engaged,\" Belle warned him, \"that you can't\n",
      "write me and draw out of the snare if you wish when you're older. And\n",
      "I'm not going to wear any ring until you've graduated from the Naval\n",
      "Academy. Do you understand that, Mr. David Darrin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be as you say, either way,\" Dave replied happily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now, let us get started, or we shan't get out on the street\n",
      "to-day,\" urged Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they passed out on the street, and no ordinarily observant person\n",
      "would have suspected them of being anything more than school friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being very matter-of-fact in some respects, Belle's first move was to go\n",
      "to a stationer's, where she bought a little notebook bound in red\n",
      "leather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave tried to pay for that purchase, but Belle forestalled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you allow me to make you that little gift?\" he asked in a\n",
      "low tone, when they had reached the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait,\" replied Belle archly. \"Some day you may find your hands full in\n",
      "that line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my instructors at Annapolis complimented me on having very\n",
      "capable hands,\" Dave told her dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The instructor in boxing?\" asked Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wonderfully delightful stroll that the middy and his sweetheart\n",
      "enjoyed that September forenoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Dave sighed, so pronouncedly that Belle shot a quick look of\n",
      "questioning at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tired of our understanding already?\" she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I was thinking how sorry I am for Danny boy! He doesn't know the\n",
      "happiness of having a real sweetheart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know he doesn't?\" asked Belle quickly. \"Does he tell you\n",
      "everything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but I know Danny's sea-going lines pretty well. I'd suspect, at\n",
      "least, if he had a sweetheart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure that you would?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes! By gracious! There's Danny going around the corner above at\n",
      "this very moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle had looked in the same instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and a skirt swished around the corner with him,\" declared Belle\n",
      "impressively. \"It would be funny, wouldn't it, if you didn't happen to\n",
      "know all about Dan Dalzell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early afternoon, however, the mystery was cleared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the street Dalzell had encountered Laura Bentley. Both were full of\n",
      "talk and questions concerning Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, at West\n",
      "Point, for which reason Dan had strolled home with Miss Bentley without\n",
      "any other thought, on the midshipman's part, than playing substitute\n",
      "gallant for his chum, Cadet Richard Prescott, U.S. Military Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A most delightful afternoon the four young people spent together at the\n",

      "\n",
      "These were the forerunners of other afternoons.\n",
      "\n",

      "themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other girls, former students at the High School, arranged a series of\n",
      "affairs to which the four young people were invited.\n",

      "Dan's happiest moments, on the other hand, were when he was engaged in\n",
      "hunting the old High School fellows, or such of them as were now at\n",
      "home. For many of them had entered colleges or technical schools. Tom\n",
      "Reade and Harry Hazelton, of the famous old Dick & Co., of High School\n",

      "\n",
      "Dan had a happy enough time of it, even though Dave's suspicion was true\n",

      "\n",
      "Then came the day when Dave and Dan met at the railway station. A host\n",

      "He sat in his chair, in their new quarters in Bancroft Hall, United\n",

      "\n",
      "These text-books contained the subjects in which a midshipman is\n",
      "required to qualify in his second academic year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Been through the books for a first look?\" called Dave from behind his\n",
      "own study table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of 'em,\" admitted Dalzell. \"I'm afraid to glance into the others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've looked in all of my books,\" continued Darrin, \"and I've just come\n",
      "to a startling conclusion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm inclined to believe that I have received a complete set of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No such luck!\" grunted Dan, getting up and going over to his chum. \"Let\n",
      "me see if you got all the books I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Dave could prevent it, Dan started a determined over-tossing of\n",
      "the book pile. As he did so, Dan suddenly uncovered a photograph from\n",
      "which a fair, sweet, laughing face gazed up at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I beg a million pardons, Dave, old boy!\" cried Dalzell.\n",

      "subject at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, seriously,\" Dan grumbled on, after a while, \"I'm aghast at what an\n",
      "exacting government expects and demands that we shall know. Just look\n",
      "over the list--mechanical drawing and mechanical processes, analytical\n",

      "\n",

      "as well as his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the days went by, however, Dave and Dan became more and more dull of\n",
      "spirits. The grind was a fearful one. A few very bright youngsters went\n",
      "along all right, but to most of the third classmen graduation began to\n",
      "look a thousand years away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The football squad was out now and training in deadly earnest. There\n",
      "were many big games to be played, but most of all the middies longed to\n",
      "tow West Point's Army eleven into the port of defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their first year Dave and Dan had looked forward longingly to joining\n",
      "the gridiron squad. They had even practised somewhat. But now they\n",
      "realized that playing football in the second year at Annapolis must be,\n",
      "for them, merely a foolish dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm thankful enough if I can study day and night and keep myself up to\n",
      "2.5,\" confessed Darrin, as he and Dan chatted over their gridiron\n",
      "longings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-and-five tenths is the lowest marking, on a scale of four, that will\n",
      "suffice to keep a midshipman in the Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to reach 2.5 in some studies this month,\" groaned Dan. \"I\n",
      "know that much by way of advance information. The fates be thanked that\n",
      "we're allowed until the semi-ans to pick up. But the question is, are we\n",
      "ever going to pick up? As I look through my books it seems to me that\n",
      "every succeeding lesson is twice as hard as the one before it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Other men have gone through, every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And still other men have been dropped every year,\" Dalzell dolefully\n",
      "reminded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're among those who are going to stay,\" Dave contended stubbornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'm afraid we'll be among those who are dropped after Christmas\n",
      "and come back, next year, as bilgers,\" Dalzell groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, drop that!\" commanded Darrin, almost roughly. \"Remember one thing,\n",
      "Daniel little lion slayer! My congressman and your senator won't appoint\n",
      "us again, if we fail now. No talk of that kind, remember. We've got to\n",
      "make our standing secure within the next few weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the month was over the football games began in earnest on the\n",
      "athletic field. Darrin and Dalzell, however, missed every game. They\n",
      "were too busy poring over their text-books. Fortunately for them their\n",
      "drills, parades and gym. work furnished them enough exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of October found Darrin at or above 2.5 in only three studies.\n",
      "Dan was above 2.5 in two studies--below that mark in all others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a pity my father never taught me to swear,\" grumbled Dalzell, in\n",
      "the privacy of their room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stow that talk,\" ordered Darrin, \"and shove off into the deeper waters\n",
      "of greater effort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Greater effort?\" demanded Dan, in a rage. \"Why I study, now, every\n",
      "possible moment of the time allowed for such foolishness. And we can't\n",
      "run a light. Right after taps the electric light is turned off at the\n",
      "master switch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're wasting ninety seconds of precious time, now, in grumbling,\"\n",
      "uttered Dave, seating himself doggedly at his study table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Got any money, Darry?\" asked Dalzell suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; are you broke?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am, and the next time I go into Annapolis I mean to buy some\n",
      "candles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't try that, Danny. Running a light is dangerous, and doubly so with\n",
      "candles. The grease is bound to drip, and to be found in some little\n",
      "corner by one of the discipline officers. It would be no use to study if\n",
      "you are going to get frapped on the pap continuously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after supper both midshipmen forfeited their few minutes of\n",
      "recreation, going at once back to their study tables. There they\n",
      "remained, boning hard until the brief release sounded before taps was\n",
      "due.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at the sound of the release there came a knock at the door.\n",
      "Farley and his roommate, Page, came bounding in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to say something, or I'll go daffy,\" cried Farley, rubbing his\n",
      "eyes. \"Fellows, did you ever hear of such downright abuse as the second\n",
      "year course of studies means?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is tough,\" agreed Dave. \"But what can we do about it, except fight\n",
      "it out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you make head or tail out of calculus?\" demanded Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" admitted Darrin, \"but I hope to, one of these days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Freeman, of the first class, poked his head in, after a soft\n",
      "knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this--a despair meeting?\" he called cheerily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" groaned Page. \"We're in a blue funk over the way recitations are\n",
      "going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, buck up, kiddies!\" called Freeman cheerily, as he crossed the\n",
      "floor. \"Youngsters always get in the doldrums at the beginning of the\n",
      "year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a first classman. When you were in the third class did you have\n",
      "all the studies that we have now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every one of them, sir,\" affirmed Midshipman Freeman gravely, though\n",
      "there was a twinkle in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did you come through the course easily?\" asked Page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not easily,\" admitted the first classman. \"There isn't anything at\n",
      "Annapolis that is easy, except the dancing. In fact, during the first\n",
      "two months very few of our class came along like anything at all. After\n",
      "that, we began to do better. By the time that semi-ans came around\n",
      "nearly all of us managed to pull through. But what seems to be the worst\n",
      "grind of all--the real blue paint?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Calculus!\" cried the four youngsters in unison.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, once you begin to see daylight in calculus it's just as easy as\n",
      "taking a nap,\" declared the first classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At present it seems more like suffering from delirium,\" sighed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the hard one for to-morrow?\" asked Freeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here it is, right here,\" continued Dave, opening his text-book. \"Here's\n",
      "the very proposition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The others crowded about, nodding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember that one,\" laughed Freeman lightly. \"Our class named it\n",
      "'sticky fly paper.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was rightly named,\" grumbled Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of you four youngsters see through it?\" demanded Midshipman\n",
      "Freeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to claim, sir, that you ever did?\" insisted Dan Dalzell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not only once, but now,\" grinned Mr. Freeman. \"You haven't been looking\n",
      "at this torturing proposition from the right angle--that's all. Now,\n",
      "listen, while I read it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we all know how it runs, Mr. Freeman,\" protested Page.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless, listen, while I read it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the first classman read through the proposition that was torturing\n",
      "them he threw an emphasis upon certain words that opened their eyes\n",
      "better as to the meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, it works out this way,\" continued the first classman, bending over\n",
      "the disk and drawing paper and pencil toward him. \"In the first place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Freeman seemed to these youngsters like a born demonstrator. Within five\n",
      "minutes he had made the \"sticky fly paper\" problem so plain to them all\n",
      "that they glanced from one to another in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it does seem easy,\" confessed Farley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It sounds foolish, now,\" grinned Darrin. \"I'm beginning to feel ashamed\n",
      "of myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Freeman,\" protested Page, \"you've saved us from suicide, or some\n",
      "other gruesome fate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll drop in once in a while again,\" promised the first classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that will take time from your own studies,\" remonstrated Darrin\n",
      "generously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least. I won't come around before release. By the time a\n",
      "fellow reaches the first class, if he's going to graduate anyway, he\n",
      "doesn't have to study as hard as a youngster does. The man who reaches\n",
      "the first class has had all the habits of true study ground into him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin, Dalzell, Farley and Page were all in different sections in\n",
      "mathematics. When they recited, next day, it so happened that each was\n",
      "the man to have the \"sticky fly paper\" problem assigned to him by the\n",
      "instructor. Each of the quartette received a full \"4\" for the day's\n",
      "marking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you have any assistance with this problem, Mr. Darrin?\" asked\n",
      "Dave's instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; a member of the first class tried to make it plain to me last\n",
      "night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He appears to have succeeded,\" remarked the instructor dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, however, no discredit attached to having received proper\n",
      "assistance before coming into section.\n",
      "\n",
      "True to his promise Freeman dropped in every fourth or fifth evening, to\n",
      "see if he could be of any help to the four youngsters. Always he found\n",
      "that he could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when Thanksgiving came, Dave Darrin did not go to Philadelphia, but\n",
      "remained at the Academy, devoting his time to study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan, in sheer desperation, took in the trip to Philadelphia. He hoped\n",
      "to meet Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, but they did not come down from\n",

      "\n",
      "On the first day of December, Dan Dalzell's name was formally reported\n",
      "by the Academic Board in a report to the superintendent which\n",

      "\"inaptitude in his studies.\"\n",

      "On the evening of the day following there was to be a midshipman hop on\n",
      "the floor of the great gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it was the very hop that Belle Meade and Laura Bentley had\n",
      "finally selected to attend. Mrs. Meade was coming with the girls as\n",
      "chaperon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I shall feel fine and light hearted for going to the dance!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I shan't feel a whole lot more merry myself,\" sighed Dave, as he gazed\n",
      "affectionately, wistfully at his chum. \"Danny, this has hit me about as\n",
      "hard as it has you. And it warns me, too, that my turn will probably\n",
      "come next. I don't stand an awful lot higher in my markings than you\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doesn't it feel fine to be a bilger?\" gulped Dalzell, staring at the\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "A \"bilger,\" as has been already explained, is a midshipman who has\n",
      "failed and has been dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but you're not a bilger, yet!\" cried Darrin, leaping up and resting\n",
      "both hands on his chum's shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the odds?\" demanded Dan grimly. \"I shall be, after I've been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense! Not if you make a good fight!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fight--nothing!\" sighed Dan wearily. \"In a fight there's some one else\n",
      "that you can hit back at. But I won't have a blessed soul to fight. I'm\n",
      "up against a gang who are all referees, and all down on me at the\n",
      "outset.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" combatted Dave. \"You----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's all right, David, little giant,\" returned Dalzell with an\n",
      "attempt at cheeriness. \"You mean well, but a fellow isn't reported\n",
      "deficient unless he's so far behind that the Board has his case settled\n",
      "in advance. From all I can hear it isn't once in a camel's age that a\n",
      "fellow so reported, and ordered before the Board, gets off with anything\n",
      "less than a hard, wet bilge. What I'm thinking of now is, what am I\n",
      "going to pick up as a career when I go home from here as a failure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If it hadn't been for the pride he felt in still having the uniform on,\n",
      "Dalzell might not have been able to check the tears that tried to flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on,\" commanded Dave, leaping up, \"we'll run up to the deck above,\n",
      "and see if we can't find Mr. Freeman in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What good will that do?\" demanded Dan. \"Freeman is a first classman,\n",
      "but he hasn't any particular drag with the Board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It won't do any harm, anyway, for us to have a talk with an older\n",
      "classman,\" argued Dave. \"Button your blouse, straighten your hair and\n",
      "come along.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it's as bad as that, is it!\" asked Freeman sympathetically, after\n",
      "his cheery \"come in\" had admitted the unhappy youngsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Dave incisively. \"Now, the question is, what can be done\n",
      "about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you had asked me an easier one,\" sighed the first classman.\n",
      "\"You're mighty well liked, all through the Academy, Dalzell, and every\n",
      "one of us will hate to see you go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what can be done to ward off that fate?\" insisted Darrin as\n",
      "impatiently as a third classman might speak to a venerable first\n",
      "classman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now, I want to think over that,\" confessed Freeman frankly. \"Of\n",
      "course, Dalzell's record, this term, is in black and white, and can't be\n",
      "gainsaid. It's just possible our young friend can put up some line of\n",
      "talk that will extend his time here, and perhaps enable him to pull\n",
      "through. It's a mighty important question, so I'll tell you what we'll\n",
      "do. Of course, the hop comes on for to-morrow night. Let me have until\n",
      "Sunday evening. Meanwhile I'll talk with some of the other fellows of my\n",
      "class. You both come in here Sunday evening, and I'll have the answer\n",
      "for you--if there's any possible way of finding one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With that the chums had to be content. Expressing their gratitude to\n",
      "this friendly first classman, they withdrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Saturday forenoon Dan did considerably better with the two\n",
      "recitations that he had in hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I got easier questions than usual, I guess,\" he said to Dave, with a\n",
      "mournful smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Saturday dinner, Dave and Dan, having secured permission to visit\n",
      "in Annapolis, steered their course through the gate, straight up\n",
      "Maryland Avenue, through State Circle and around into Main Street, to\n",
      "the Maryland House.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the desk they sent up their cards to Mrs. Meade, then stepped into\n",
      "the parlor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barely two minutes had passed when Belle and Laura flew downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother says she'll be down as soon as she fancies you'll care about\n",
      "seeing her,\" laughed Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how are you getting on in your classes?\" asked Laura Bentley,\n",
      "glancing straight at unhappy Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both midshipmen had agreed not to mention a word of Dan's heartache to\n",
      "either of the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan gulped hard, though he managed to conceal the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darrin, however, was ready with the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we're having pretty rough sailing, but we're both still in our\n",
      "class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which statement was wholly truthful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up at West Point,\" Laura continued, \"Dick told us that the first two\n",
      "years were the hardest for a man to keep his place. I fancy it's just\n",
      "about the same here, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just about,\" Dave nodded. \"The first two years are hardest because it\n",
      "takes all that time for a fellow to get himself keyed up to the gait of\n",
      "study that is required in the government academies. But won't you let us\n",
      "talk about something that's really pleasant, girls?\" Dave asked, with\n",
      "his charming smile. \"Suppose we talk about yourselves. My, but you girls\n",
      "are good to look at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the conversation was shifted to lighter subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Dan, in the joy of meeting two girl friends from home, began to be\n",
      "less conscious of his load of misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Mrs. Meade came down. She chatted with the two fine-looking\n",
      "young midshipmen for a few moments. Then Dave proposed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you like us to escort you through the Academy grounds, so that\n",
      "you can get a good idea of the place in daylight?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been waiting only for you to invite us,\" rejoined Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next two hours the time was passed pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Belle, behind all her light chatter, was unusually keen and\n",
      "observing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is anything wrong with either of you?\" she asked Dave suddenly, when\n",
      "this pair were out of easy hearing of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you ask that?\" inquired Dave, looking at her in his direct\n",
      "fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I may be unnecessarily sensitive, but I can't help feeling that\n",
      "some sort of disaster is hanging over either you or Dan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" replied Darrin evasively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave, that isn't a direct answer,\" warned Belle, raising her eyebrows.\n",
      "\"Do you consider me entitled to one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. What's the question?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you in any trouble here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm thankful to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then is Dan!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle, I'd rather not answer that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, because, if he is, I'd rather not discuss it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has Dan been caught in any scrape?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. His conduct record is fine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it must be failure in his studies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you tell me?\" insisted Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anything were in the wind, Belle, we'd rather not tell you and spoil\n",
      "your visit. And don't ask Dan anything about it.\"\n",

      "you've made your place in life. But it was Dave Darrin to whom I gave\n",
      "that half promise--not a uniform of any sort. Dave, if anything ever\n",
      "happens that you have to quit here, don't imagine that it's going to\n",

      "to be reassured once in a while.\"\n",

      "It was a particularly gay and pleasant hop. When it was over Dave and\n",

      "in Bancroft Hall seemed especially small and dingy to the returning\n",
      "midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Especially was Dan Dalzell in the blues. Though he had been outwardly\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Meade and the girls returned by an early morning train, so the two\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Cut it!\" begged Dan dolefully. \"Don't try to jolly me along like that.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Don't dare to,\" replied Dalzell morosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, though Darrin went out, he resolved not to remain long away from his\n",
      "moody chum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, on one of the cement walks, Dave turned toward Flirtation Walk.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That was a dirty trick you played me last night, Mr. Darrin!\" cried the\n",
      "first classman angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" gasped Dave, astonished, for this was not in line with the usual\n",
      "conversation of midshipmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know well enough what I mean,\" cried Treadwell angrily. \"You spiked\n",
      "my only chance to dance with Miss Meade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're wrong there,\" retorted Dave coldly and truthfully \"I didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then how did it happen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't discuss that with you,\" Darrin rejoined. \"I didn't make any\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin, I don't choose to believe you, sir!\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, very good, then, Mr. Treadwell,\" retorted Dave, eyeing the first\n",
      "classman and sizing him up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treadwell was one of the biggest men, physically, in the brigade. He was\n",
      "also one of the noted fighters of his class. Beside Treadwell,\n",
      "Midshipman Darrin did not size up at all advantageously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you do not retract what you just said,\" pursued Dave Darrin, growing\n",
      "cooler now that he realized the deliberate nature of the affront that\n",
      "had been put upon him, \"I shall have no choice but to send my friends to\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Delighted to see them, at any time,\" replied the first classman,\n",
      "turning disdainfully upon his heel and strolling away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, why on earth does that fellow deliberately pick a fight with me?\"\n",
      "wondered Darrin, as he strolled along by himself. \"Treadwell can thump\n",

      "what credit is there in it for a first classman to thrash a youngster?\"\n",

      "Things were happening fast--Dan's impending \"bilge\" from the Naval\n",

      "\n",
      "Many a young man, doomed to be sent forth from a Naval career, back into\n",

      "\"I am aware, sir, and gentlemen, that I am at present sufficiently\n",

      "slowly. \"Yet I would call attention to the fact that I was nearly as\n",
      "badly off, in the matter of markings, at this time last year. It is also\n",
      "a matter of record that I pulled myself together, later on, and\n",

      "\"Why--\"\n",
      "\n",

      "a strong clasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the others present had the least idea of the provocation of\n",
      "this strange, spirited double fight. All, however, were glad to see the\n",
      "difficulty mended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dave and his seconds, leaving the field first, made their way back\n",

      "\"David, little giant,\" exclaimed Dalzell, leaping about him, \"that fight\n",

      "ever dare to leave me out again!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't such a much,\" smiled Dave rather wearily, as he went over to\n",

      "have a right to know that, Danny boy. But you must never repeat it to\n",
      "any one. Treadwell wanted to dance with Belle at the hop, but she had\n",
      "already noticed him, and declared she didn't want to dance with him. Of\n",
      "course that settled it. But Treadwell accused me of not having asked\n",
      "Belle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The nerve !\" ejaculated Dan in disgust.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There must be fine stuff in Mr. Darrin,\" murmured the marine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you see that much just now?\" demanded the sailor, who took the\n",
      "remark as almost a personal affront, \"My hat's off to Mr. Darrin. He's\n",
      "one of our future admirals. If I round out my days in the service it\n",

      "Through the main entrance of Bancroft Hall, into the stately corridor,\n",
      "Lieutenant Willow picked his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked solemn--unusually so, even for Lieutenant Willow, U.S.N. He\n",
      "had the air of a man who hates to do his duty, but who is convinced that\n",
      "the heavens would fall if he didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his left he turned, acknowledging smartly the crisp salute given him\n",
      "by the midshipman assistant officer of the day.\n",

      "Into the outer office of the officer in charge stepped Mr. Willow, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Stearns, he of the round, jovial face, gazed at his junior with\n",
      "twinkling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willow,\" he muttered, \"I'm half inclined to believe that you've come\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It must be something fearful,\" said Mr. Stearns, who knew the junior\n",
      "officer's inclination to be duty-mad. \"But, see here, if you make an\n",
      "official report you'll force me to take action, even though it's\n",
      "something that I'd secretly slap a midshipman on the shoulder for doing.\n",
      "No--don't begin to talk yet, Willow. Try a cigar and then tell me,\n",
      "personally, what's worrying you. Then perhaps it won't be altogether\n",
      "needful to make an official report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never was able to take you--er--somewhat jovial views of an officer's\n",

      "a few whiffs, Lieutenant-Commander Stearns all the while regarding his\n",
      "comrade in arms with twinkling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, fire ahead, Willow,\" urged the officer in charge, \"but please\n",

      "\"No!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "a tone of mock incredulity. \"No, no, no, Willow, you don't mean it--you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" rejoined the junior officer rather stiffly.\n",

      "\"Oh, dear, what is the service coming to?\" gasped Stearns ironically.\n",
      "\"Why, Willow, we never heard of such things when we were midshipmen\n",
      "here. Now, did we?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid we did--sometimes,\" admitted the junior officer. \"But duty\n",
      "is duty, you know, my dear Stearns. And this was an unusual fight, too.\n",
      "The man who was whipped insisted on another fight right then and there,\n",
      "and--he won the second fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bully!\" chuckled the officer in charge. \"Whew, but I wish I had been\n",

      "\"You're quite right, Willow. No; I certainly don't want to be a\n",

      "could have taken in such a scene as that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm--I'm just a bit astonished at your saying it, Stearns,\" rejoined\n",
      "Lieutenant Willow. \"But then, you're always joking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I am joking,\" assented the officer in charge dryly, \"but I\n",
      "never lose sight of the fact that our Navy has been built up, at huge\n",
      "expense, as a great fighting machine. Now, Willow, it takes fighting men\n",
      "to run a fighting machine. Of course, I'm terribly shocked to know that\n",
      "two midshipmen really had the grit to fight--but who were they! Mind\n",
      "you, I'm not asking you in an official way. This question is purely\n",
      "personal--just between ourselves. Who were the men? And, especially, who\n",
      "was the fellow who lost the decision, and then had the utter effrontery\n",
      "to demand a second chance at once, only to win the second fight?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darrin was the man who lost the first fight and won the second,\"\n",
      "replied Lieutenant Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Darrin? One of our youngsters! Yes; I think I know him. And what\n",
      "man of his class did he whip, the second time he tried!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't a man of his own class. It was Mr. Treadwell, of the first\n",
      "class,\" rejoined Lieutenant Willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" almost exploded the officer in charge. \"Did you say that Mr.\n",
      "Darrin fought with Mr. Treadwell, that husky top classman, and, losing\n",
      "the decision on the count, insisted on fighting again the same evening?\n",
      "Oh, say, what a fellow misses by being cooped up in an office like\n",
      "this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--but the breach of regulations!\" stammered the duty-mad lieutenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, neither you nor I know anything about this\n",
      "fight--officially. The Navy, after all, is a fighting machine. Do you\n",
      "feel that the Navy can afford to lose a fighting man like that\n",
      "youngster?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Lieutenant Willow left Lieutenant-Commander Stearns' presence, not\n",
      "quite convinced he was performing his whole duty, but glad to bow to the\n",
      "decision of a ranking officer.\n",

      "homes, where there were so many midshipmen, it was as a rule only the\n",
      "young men who made themselves prominent socially who captured these\n",
      "coveted invitations. Darrin and Dalzell concealed their surprise, but\n",
      "expressed their pleasure in accepting the gracious invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering Mrs. Stearns' drawing room the next Sunday Mr. Darrin and\n",
      "Mr. Dalzell were introduced to two pretty girls. Miss Flora Gentle was a\n",
      "cousin of their hostess. She had visited Annapolis before, and, being\n",
      "pretty and vivacious, at the same time kind and considerate, she had\n",
      "many friends among the midshipmen. Marian Stevens, who had accompanied\n",
      "her on this visit, was a direct contrast. Flora was blonde. Marian was\n",
      "the dark, flashing type. She was spoiled and imperious, yet she had a\n",
      "dashing, open way about her that made her a favorite among young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two girls had heard of the double fight. Marian, therefore, was\n",
      "pleased when she found that Dave was to be her dinner partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's handsome,\" thought the girl, \"and he's brave and dashing. He'll\n",
      "make his mark in the Navy. He doesn't know it yet, but he'll become\n",
      "mine, and mine alone.\"\n",

      "Miss Stevens was a calculating young person, and had already decided\n",
      "that Navy life was the life for her and that she would marry into it.\n",
      "At seventeen, she looked upon the officers as old men, even the\n",
      "youngest of them, so was giving her time and her smiles to the\n",
      "midshipmen. That the Navy pay is small did not trouble Maid Marian, as\n",
      "she liked to be called, as on her twenty-first birthday she would come\n",
      "into a considerable fortune of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She exerted herself all through the Stearns' dinner to captivate Dave\n",
      "Darrin. He, without diminution of love and loyalty to Belle Mead, was\n",
      "glad to be on friendly terms with this dashing and sprightly girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee was served in the drawing room. Several officers dropped in.\n",
      "Marian, who wished no one to come between her and Dave for a while,\n",
      "turned to her host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Stearns, do the regulations make it improper for Flora and me to\n",
      "ask Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell to take us for a stroll about the yard?\"\n",
      "she asked with a pretty air of deference. The \"yard\" includes all the\n",
      "grounds belonging to the Naval Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do not, Miss Marian,\" was the smiling response.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With our hostess's approval we shall be charmed to grant any request\n",
      "the young ladies make,\" ventured Dave, as Marian smiled into his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marian, the wily and experienced, found herself baffled during this\n",
      "walk. Using all her cajoleries, she could bring him to a certain point\n",
      "beyond which he would not go. As a matter of fact, Dave Darrin, secure\n",
      "in his loyalty to Belle, did not perceive what Maid Marian was striving\n",
      "to lead up to, but saw in her only a lively and interesting girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you yet, Midshipman Darrin,\" she vowed to herself after they\n",
      "had parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gossip of a sweetheart in his home town which in time reached her\n",
      "ears only made the girl more determined to get her way. Looking in the\n",
      "mirror with satisfaction, she murmured:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be the added zest of making Midshipman Darrin forget the\n",
      "distant face of that home girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not on that visit did Maid Marian succeed in leading Dave beyond the\n",
      "point of simple but sincere friendship. However, Miss Stevens could be\n",
      "charming to whomsoever she wished, and before she left Annapolis she had\n",
      "secured invitations to visit the wife of more than one of the officers.\n",

      "CHAPTER XX\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas came and went, and soon after this the semi-annual\n",
      "examinations were on in earnest. Some of the midshipmen failed and sadly\n",
      "turned their faces homeward to make a place for themselves in some other\n",
      "lane of life. Dan Dalzell, however, made good his promise, and by a\n",
      "better margin than he had dared hope. Dave came through the examination\n",
      "somewhat better than his chum. Both felt assured now that they would\n",
      "round out the year with fair credit to themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian Stevens came to Annapolis several times during the latter half of\n",
      "the year, and as it is expected that the future officer shall have\n",
      "social as well as Naval training, Dave Darrin met her often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exasperation that she could draw the young midshipman on only so far\n",
      "soon changed in Miss Stevens to anger and chagrin. Still Dave, giving\n",
      "prolonged thought to no girl except Belle Meade, saw in her only a\n",
      "lively companion. Sometimes he was her dinner partner. Always at a dance\n",
      "he danced with her more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at one such dance that she looked up as they circled the room to\n",
      "say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if you know, Mr. Darrin, how much I enjoy dancing with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not as much as I enjoy dancing with you,\" he replied smilingly. Just\n",
      "then the music stopped suddenly and an officer called in a voice that\n",
      "carried over the great floor of the gymnasium and over all the chatter:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies and gentlemen, one moment's attention, please!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant all was still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" continued the officer, \"official permission has\n",
      "been granted for taking a flashlight photograph of the scene to-night.\n",
      "Will everybody please remain where he is until after the exposure has\n",
      "been made?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave and Marian had paused directly in front of the lens of the camera.\n",
      "Maid Marian looked up and made a light, jesting remark, gazing straight\n",
      "into the midshipman's eyes. Dave, smiling, bent forward to hear what she\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then came the flash, and the photographer, his work finished for\n",
      "the time, gathered his paraphernalia together and left. The music\n",
      "recommenced and the dancing proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three weeks later that photograph was reproduced as a double-page\n",
      "illustration in one of the prominent pictorial weeklies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day the magazine was on the newsstands Dan Dalzell bought a copy.\n",
      "Entering their quarters with it in his hand he opened it at the\n",
      "illustration and handed it to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and Miss Stevens show up better than any one else, Dave,\" remarked\n",
      "Dan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The photograph is a good piece of work,\" was Dave's only comment. He\n",
      "did not wish to express the annoyance he felt when he noted the\n",
      "appearance of intimacy between him and Marian, whose beauty showed, even\n",
      "in this reproduction. \"I'd a bit rather Belle shouldn't see this paper,\"\n",
      "he admitted to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"David, old boy, this picture would make a good exhibit in a\n",
      "breach-of-promise suit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's an unkind remark to make about a fine girl like Miss Stevens,\"\n",
      "said Dave coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan stared, then went off, pondering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle Meade, in her Gridley home, received one day a large, square, thin\n",
      "package. She saw the mark of the Annapolis express office, and hastily\n",
      "snatched up scissors to cut the string. Out came a huge photograph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A picture of an Annapolis dance! How thoughtful of Dave to send it to\n",
      "me!\" Then her eyes fell on two figures around which a ring had been\n",
      "drawn in ink. They were Dave Darrin and a pretty girl. On the margin of\n",
      "the card had been scrawled in bold letters:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your affair of the heart will bear close watching if you still\n",
      "cherish!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was signed, contemptibly and untruthfully, \"A Friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uh!\" murmured Belle in hurt pride and loyalty. Then she said resolutely\n",
      "to herself: \"I will pay no attention to this. An anonymous communication\n",
      "is always meant to hurt and to give a false impression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was the picture before her eyes of Dave and the pretty girl in\n",
      "seemingly great intimacy. So though she continued to write to the\n",
      "midshipman and tried hard to make her letters sound as usual, in spite\n",
      "of herself a coldness crept into them that Dave felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She must have seen that pictorial weekly,\" thought the boy miserably.\n",
      "But as Belle said nothing of this, he could not write of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season was well along. Dave and Dan sent Belle Meade and Laura\n",
      "Bentley invitations to one of the later spring dances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if she'll come or if she's tiring of me,\" thought Dave Darrin\n",
      "bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Belle answered, accepting the invitation for Laura and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Saturday afternoon came both midshipmen hurried to the hotel in the\n",
      "town and sent up their cards. Mrs. Meade soon appeared, saying the girls\n",
      "would be down shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they both well?\" asked Dave. His tone was as one giving a\n",
      "meaningless greeting, but in his heart he waited anxiously to hear what\n",
      "her mother should say of Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, yes. But Belle has been moping around the house a great deal,\n",
      "Dave, rather unlike her usual self,\" replied Mrs. Meade slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mrs. Meade deplored this, Dave Darrin did not. It showed him at least\n",
      "that the girl's apparent coldness was not caused by her interest in some\n",
      "other young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the girls came in and Belle greeted him cordially, to be sure,\n",
      "but with something of restraint, his heart sank again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter, Belle? Has something gone wrong?\" asked Dave when\n",
      "Dan was engaging the attention of Mrs. Meade and Laura.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing. Is all right with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave, when we're alone I have something to show you. I fear you have an\n",
      "enemy here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An enemy! Oh, no. But I shall be glad to see what you have to show me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before, at a word from Dave, Dan took Mrs. Meade and\n",
      "Laura out for a walk. It was then that Belle got the large photograph\n",
      "with the two figures ringed in ink and showed it to Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what does this mean? Some one must have taken a good deal of\n",
      "trouble to secure this photograph. The picture was taken for a pictorial\n",
      "weekly. One can get a photograph from which the cut is made, but it is\n",
      "troublesome and possibly expensive!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have an enemy, then; some one bent on hurting you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know who it could be. My, how angry Miss Stevens would be if\n",
      "she knew of this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Stevens? Is that the girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. She's visited here often this year. She knows a number of the\n",
      "officers' wives. She's vivacious and always has a good time, but she's\n",
      "nothing to me, Belle. You know that, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never doubted you, Dave. Let us tear this up. I thought at first\n",
      "I'd not show it to you; then decided it was best not to begin concealing\n",
      "things from you. But let us not think of the thing again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Belle, you're a thoroughbred!\" and here the matter dropped as far as it\n",
      "was between Dave Darrin and Belle Meade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Stevens was at the dance that evening. Though she tried hard to\n",
      "make that impossible, Dave did not dance with her, nor did he introduce\n",
      "her to Belle, though there again Marian tried to force this.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been well for Marian if Dan Dalzell had been equally\n",
      "circumspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time it was Belle who contrived and got the introduction to the\n",
      "other girl, but Marian was by no means reluctant, so it was that they\n",
      "managed to get a few moments alone together when they had sent their\n",
      "dance partners to get something for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a friend of Dave's, aren't you?\" asked Marian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of Mr. Darrin's? Oh, yes, we've always known each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you've been here to many of these dances?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bad you could not have been here oftener. This has been an\n",
      "unusually brilliant season. Really, many of the young people have lost\n",
      "their heads--or their hearts. I often wonder if these midshipmen have\n",
      "sweethearts at home.\" This daring--and impertinent--remark was made\n",
      "musingly but smilingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These Annapolis affairs are never very serious, I imagine,\" Belle\n",
      "observed calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, most of the Navy marriages date back to an Annapolis\n",
      "first meeting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you think it well to come often?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless one has other ways of keeping in touch,\" was the brazen reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" said Belle sweetly. \"I receive a good many souvenirs in the\n",
      "course of a year. One last winter was a photograph.\" With the words\n",
      "Belle gazed intently into Miss Stevens' eyes. Then she went on: \"There\n",
      "was an anonymous message written on it. It was a lying message, of\n",
      "course, as anonymous messages always are, written in a coarse hand. Did\n",
      "you ever study handwriting, Miss Stevens?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian gasped, realizing she was out-maneuvered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This writing had all the characteristics of a woman whose instincts are\n",
      "coarse, that of a treacherous though not dangerous person--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Mr. Sanderson back. Will you excuse me, Miss Meade?\" and Marian\n",
      "fairly fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belle told Dave she had found out who had sent the photograph, but\n",
      "added:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you wouldn't ask me who it was, Dave. I can assure you that the\n",
      "person who did it will never trouble us again,\" and as Dave did not like\n",
      "to think evil of any one, he consented, and continued to think of Marian\n",
      "Stevens, when he thought of her at all, as a jolly girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The annual examinations were approaching. Dan Dalzell was buried deep in\n",
      "gloom. Dave Darrin kept cheerful outwardly, but doubts crept into his\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The examinations over, Dave felt reasonably safe. But Dan's gloom\n",
      "deepened, for he was sure he had failed in \"skinny,\" as the boys termed\n",
      "chemistry and physics. So it was that when the grades were posted Dave\n",
      "scanned the D's in the list of third classmen who had passed. Dan, on\n",
      "the other hand, turned instantly to what he termed the \"bust list.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, why, I'm not there!\" he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at the passing list, Danny,\" laughed Dave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbelieving, Dan turned his eyes on the list and to his utter\n",
      "astonishment found his name posted. True, in \"skinny\" he had a bare\n",
      "passing mark. But in other subjects he was somewhat above the minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you see, old man, we'll both be here next year as second classmen,\"\n",
      "said Dave jubilantly.\n",
