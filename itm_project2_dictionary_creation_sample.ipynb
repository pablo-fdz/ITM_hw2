      "that they were the result of the indigestible Golden family meals; she\n",
      "tried to take comfort by noticing their prevalence among other girls;\n",
      "but they kept startling her anew; she would secretly touch them with a\n",

      "like all the post-card views of it, so stolidly devoid of any surprises,\n",

      "The familiar faces of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sessions were awaiting them at\n",

      "immediately became a blur of cabs, cobblestones, bales of cotton, long\n",
      "vistas of very dirty streets, high buildings, surface cars, elevateds,\n",
      "shop windows that seemed dark and foreign, and everywhere such a rush of\n",
      "people as made her feel insecure, cling to the Sessionses, and try to\n",
      "ward off the dizziness of the swirl of new impressions. She was daunted\n",

      "like this madness of multiform energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sessionses lived in a flat on Amsterdam Avenue near Ninety-sixth\n",
      "Street. They all went up from Cortlandt Street in the Subway, which was\n",
      "still new and miraculous in 1905. For five minutes Una was terrified by\n",

      "of being powerlessly hurled forward in a mass of ungovernable steel. But\n",
      "nothing particularly fatal happened; and she grew proud to be part of\n",

      "Panama, and which looked plaintively rustic here in New York, Una gave\n",
      "herself up to impressions of the city: the voices of many children down\n",

      "again--delicatessens, laundries, barber-shops, saloons, groceries,\n",
      "lunch-rooms. She ventured down a side-street, toward a furnace-glow of\n",
      "sunset. West End Avenue was imposing to her in its solid brick and\n",
      "graystone houses, and pavements milky in the waning light. Then came a\n",
      "block of expensive apartments. She was finding the city of golden\n",
      "rewards. Frivolous curtains hung at windows; in a huge apartment-house\n",
      "hall she glimpsed a negro attendant in a green uniform with a monkey-cap\n",
      "and close-set rows of brass buttons; she had a hint of palms--or what\n",
      "looked like palms; of marble and mahogany and tiling, and a flash of\n",
      "people in evening dress. In her plain, \"sensible\" suit Una tramped past.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A dull city of straight-front unvaried streets is New York. But she\n",
      "aspires in her sky-scrapers; she dreams a garden dream of Georgian days\n",

      "\n",
      "Down a polished roadway that reflected every light rolled smart motors,\n",
      "with gay people in the sort of clothes she had studied in\n",
      "advertisements. The driveway was bordered with mist wreathing among the\n",
      "shrubs. Above Una shouldered the tremendous façades of gold-corniced\n",

      "\"Oh, I want all this--it's mine!... An apartment up there--a big, broad\n",

      "much more vulgar than she had supposed, yet also it was so much more\n",

      "conversation that was uncanny in this room of invisible whisperers; now\n",
      "leaping up to kiss the dead hand in a panic, lest it should already be\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The funeral filled the house with intruders. The drive to the cemetery\n",
      "was irritating. She wanted to leap out of the carriage. At first she\n",
      "concentrated on the cushion beside her till she thought of nothing in\n",
      "the world but the faded bottle-green upholstery, and a ridiculous drift\n",
      "of dust in the tufting. But some one was talking to her. (It was awkward\n",
      "Mr. Sessions, for shrewd Mrs. Sessions had the genius to keep still.) He\n",
      "kept stammering the most absurd platitudes about how happy her mother\n",
      "must be in a heaven regarding which he did not seem to have very recent\n",
      "or definite knowledge. She was annoyed, not comforted. She wanted to\n",
      "break away, to find her mother's presence again in that sacred place\n",
      "where she had so recently lived and spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, when Una returned to the flat, something was gone. She tried to\n",
      "concentrate on thought about immortality. She found that she had\n",
      "absolutely no facts upon which to base her thought. The hundreds of\n",
      "good, sound, orthodox sermons she had heard gave her nothing but vague\n",
      "pictures of an eternal church supper somewhere in the clouds--nothing,\n",
      "blankly and terribly nothing, that answered her bewildered wonder as to\n",
      "what had become of the spirit which had been there and now was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of her mingling of longing and doubt she realized that she\n",

      "\n",
      "The rheumatic old canary hobbled along the floor of his cage and tried\n",

      "Instantly she remembered--as clearly as though she were actually\n",

      "\"Oh, but mother didn't mean--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But in memory of that healthily vexed voice, it seemed less wicked to\n",
      "take notice of food, and after a reasonable dinner she put on her kimono\n",
      "and bedroom slippers, carefully arranged the pillows on the couch, and\n",
      "lay among them, meditating on her future.\n",
      "\n",
      "For half an hour she was afire with an eager thought: \"Why can't I\n",
      "really make a success of business, now that I can entirely devote myself\n",

      "The effect of grief is commonly reputed to be noble. But mostly it is a\n",

      "all the living; witness the mother of a son killed in war who urges her\n",

      "Grief is a paralyzing poison. It broke down Una's resistance to the\n",

      "sacred forgetfulness. It was the round of unessentials which all\n",
      "office-women know so desperately well. She bruised herself by shrinking\n",

      "her most absorbing comfort was in the luxury of mourning--passion in\n",

      "Sometimes she rushed down to the Sessionses' flat, but the good people\n",
      "bored her with their assumption that she was panting to know all the\n",
      "news from Panama. She had drifted so far away from the town that the\n",
      "sixth assertion that \"it was a great pity Kitty Wilson was going to\n",
      "marry that worthless Clark boy\" aroused no interest in her. She was\n",
      "still more bored by their phonograph, on which they played over and over\n",
      "the same twenty records. She would make quick, unconvincing excuses\n",

      "\n",
      "Her half-hysterical fear of the city's power was increased by her daily\n",
      "encounter with the clamorous streets, crowded elevators, frantic\n",

      "\n",
      "Amazing, incredible, the Subway, and the fact that human beings could\n",

      "Holy Roman Empire, Jewish factory hands, speculators from Wyoming, Iowa\n",
      "dairymen, quarreling Italian lovers, with their dramatic tales, their\n",
      "flux of every human emotion, under the city mask. But however striking\n",
      "these dramatic characters may be to the occasional spectator, they\n",
      "figure merely as an odor, a confusion, to the permanent serf of the\n",
      "Subway.... A long underground station, a catacomb with a cement\n",
      "platform, this was the chief feature of the city vista to the tired girl\n",

      "\n",

      "unladylike as to enter a polling-place, had breathed into her very mouth\n",

      "decayed teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good thing, the Subway. It did make Una quiver with the\n",
      "beginnings of rebellious thought as no suave preacher could ever have\n",

      "the policeman on the pavement, who would never think of protecting her;\n",

      "and his injured feelings as enormously important.\n",
      "\n",
      "She undressed in a tremor of misgiving. She put her thin, pretty kimono\n",

      "The three-fourths of Una employed in the office of Mr. Troy Wilkins was\n",
      "going through one of those periods of unchanging routine when all past\n",
      "drama seems unreal, when nothing novel happens nor apparently ever will\n",
      "happen--such a time of dull peacefulness as makes up the major part of\n",
      "our lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her only definite impressions were the details of daily work, the\n",
      "physical aspects of the office, and the presence of the \"Boss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "§ 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Day after day the same details of the job: letters arriving, assorted,\n",
      "opened, answered by dictation, the answers sealed and stamped (and\n",
      "almost every day the same panting crisis of getting off some cosmically\n",
      "important letter).... The reception of callers; welcome to clients;\n",
      "considerate but firm assurances to persons looking for positions that\n",
      "there was \"no opening just at _present_--\" The suave answering of\n",
      "irritating telephone calls.... The filing of letters and plans; the\n",
      "clipping of real-estate-transfer items from newspapers.... The\n",
      "supervision of Bessie Kraker and the office-boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equally fixed were the details of the grubby office itself. Like many\n",
      "men who have pride in the smartest suburban homes available, Mr. Wilkins\n",
      "was content with an office shabby and inconvenient. He regarded\n",
      "beautiful offices as in some way effeminate.... His wasn't effeminate;\n",
      "it was undecorative as a filled ash-tray, despite Una's daily following\n",
      "up of the careless scrubwomen with dust-cloth and whisk. She knew every\n",
      "inch of it, as a gardener knows his plot. She could never keep from\n",
      "noticing and running her finger along the pebbled glass of the\n",
      "oak-and-glass partition about Mr. Wilkins's private office, each of the\n",
      "hundreds of times a day she passed it; and when she lay awake at\n",
      "midnight, her finger-tips would recall precisely the feeling of that\n",
      "rough surface, even to the sharp edges of a tiny flaw in the glass over\n",
      "the bookcase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or she would recall the floor-rag--symbol of the hard realness of the\n",
      "office grind....\n",
      "\n",
      "It always hung over the twisted, bulbous lead pipes below the stationary\n",
      "basin in the women's wash-room provided by the Septimus Building for the\n",
      "women on three floors. It was a rag ancient and slate-gray, grotesquely\n",
      "stiff and grotesquely hairy at its frayed edges--a corpse of a scrub-rag\n",
      "in _rigor mortis_. Una was annoyed with herself for ever observing so\n",
      "unlovely an object, but in the moment of relaxation when she went to\n",
      "wash her hands she was unduly sensitive to that eternal rag, and to the\n",
      "griminess of the wash-room--the cracked and yellow-stained wash-bowl,\n",
      "the cold water that stung in winter, the roller-towel which she spun\n",
      "round and round in the effort to find a dry, clean, square space, till,\n",
      "in a spasm of revulsion, she would bolt out of the wash-room with her\n",
      "face and hands half dried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Woman's place is in the home. Una was doubtless purely perverse in\n",
      "competing with men for the commercial triumphs of running that gray, wet\n",
      "towel round and round on its clattering roller, and of wondering whether\n",
      "for the entire remainder of her life she would see that dead scrub-rag.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no less annoying a fact that Bessie and she had only one\n",
      "waste-basket, which was invariably at Bessie's desk when Una reached for\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or that the door of the supply-cupboard always shivered and stuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or that on Thursday, which is the three P.M. of the week, it seemed\n",
      "impossible to endure the tedium till Saturday noon; and that,\n",
      "invariably, her money was gone by Friday, so that Friday lunch was\n",
      "always a mere insult to her hunger, and she could never get her gloves\n",
      "from the cleaner till after Saturday pay-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una knew the office to a point where it offered few beautiful surprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she knew the tactics of Mr. Troy Wilkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "All managers--\"bosses\"--\"chiefs\"--have tactics for keeping discipline;\n",
      "tricks which they conceive as profoundly hidden from their underlings,\n",
      "and which are intimately known and discussed by those underlings....\n",
      "There are the bosses who \"bluff,\" those who lie, those who give\n",
      "good-fellowship or grave courtesy in lieu of wages. None of these was\n",
      "Mr. Wilkins. He was dully honest and clumsily paternal. But he was a\n",
      "roarer, a grumbler; he bawled and ordained, in order to encourage\n",
      "industry and keep his lambs from asking for \"raises.\" Thus also he tried\n",
      "to conceal his own mistakes; when a missing letter for which everybody\n",
      "had been anxiously searching was found on his own desk, instead of in\n",
      "the files, he would blare, \"Well, why didn't you tell me you put it on\n",
      "my desk, heh?\" He was a delayer also and, in poker patois, a passer of\n",
      "the buck. He would feebly hold up a decision for weeks, then make a\n",
      "whole campaign of getting his office to rush through the task in order\n",
      "to catch up; have a form of masculine-commuter hysterics because Una and\n",
      "Bessie didn't do the typing in a miraculously short time.... He never\n",
      "cursed; he was an ecclesiastical believer that one of the chief aims of\n",
      "man is to keep from saying those mystic words \"hell\" and \"damn\"; but he\n",
      "could make \"darn it\" and \"why in tunket\" sound as profane as a\n",
      "gambling-den.... There was included in Una's duties the pretense of\n",
      "believing that Mr. Wilkins was the greatest single-handed villa\n",
      "architect in Greater New York. Sometimes it nauseated her. But often he\n",
      "was rather pathetic in his shaky desire to go on having faith in his\n",
      "superseded ability, and she would willingly assure him that his rivals,\n",
      "the boisterous young firm of Soule, Smith & Fissleben, were frauds.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these faults and devices of Mr. Troy Wilkins Una knew. Doubtless he\n",
      "would have been astonished to hear that fact, on evenings in his\n",
      "plate-racked, much-raftered, highly built-in suburban dining-room, when\n",
      "he discoursed to the admiring Mrs. Wilkins and the mouse-like little\n",
      "Wilkinses on the art of office discipline; or mornings in the second\n",
      "smoker of the 8.16 train, when he told the other lords of the world that\n",
      "\"these stenographers are all alike--you simply can't get 'em to learn\n",
      "system.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not recorded whether Mr. Wilkins also knew Una's faults--her habit\n",
      "of falling a-dreaming at 3.30 and trying to make it up by working\n",
      "furiously at 4.30; her habit of awing the good-hearted Bessie Kraker by\n",
      "posing as a nun who had never been kissed nor ever wanted to be; her\n",
      "graft of sending the office-boy out for ten-cent boxes of cocoanut\n",
      "candy; and a certain resentful touchiness and ladylikeness which made it\n",
      "hard to give her necessary orders. Mr. Wilkins has never given\n",
      "testimony, but he is not the villain of the tale, and some authorities\n",

      "Save once or twice a week, when he roared, and once or twice a month,\n",
      "when she felt that thirteen dollars a week was too little, she rather\n",

      "She had real satisfaction in the game of work--in winning points and\n",

      "that a wary, long-pursued \"prospect\" had actually called. She was rather\n",

      "humanity who sell gingham and teach algebra and cure boils and repair\n",
      "lawn-mowers, because she was daily more able to approximate perfection,\n",

      "\n",
      "In any case, the lunch-hour and the catalogue of what she was so vulgar\n",
      "as to eat were of importance in Una's history, because that hour broke\n",
      "the routine, gave her for an hour a deceptive freedom of will, of choice\n",
      "between Boston beans and--New York beans. And her triumphant common\n",
      "sense was demonstrated, for she chose light, digestible food, and kept\n",

      "like vast numbers of his fellow business men, crammed himself with\n",
      "beefsteak-and-kidney pudding, drugged himself with cigar smoke and pots\n",

      "early to enjoy the contemplation of these luxuries. She even put on a\n",
      "lace bed-cap adorned with pink silk roses. The pleasure of relaxing in\n",
      "bed, of looking lazily at the pictures in a new magazine, of drifting\n",

      "She compiled little lists of books to read, \"movements\" to investigate.\n",

      "arrive not at eight-thirty, but at a quarter to eight, to gallop down to\n",
      "a cafeteria for coffee and a sandwich at noon, to be patient with\n",
      "callers, and to try to develop some knowledge of spelling in that child\n",
      "of nature, Bessie Kraker. She walked about the office quickly, glancing\n",
      "proudly at its neatness. Daily, with an operator's headgear, borrowed\n",

      "dissatisfying in general. In a few days he, in turn, reached the zenith\n",
      "of virtue on the part of boss--he raised her salary. To fifteen dollars\n",

      "innocent and bounding girlhood at the Temperance Home Club, and she\n",
      "persuaded Una to join her in taking a flat--three small rooms--which\n",
      "they made attractive with Japanese toweling and Russian, or at least\n",
      "Russian-Jew, brassware. Here Mrs. Lawrence's men came calling, and\n",
      "sometimes Mr. Julius Edward Schwirtz, and all of them, except Una\n",
      "herself, had cigarettes and highballs, and Una confusedly felt that she\n",
      "was getting to be an Independent Woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in January, 1909, she left the stiff, gray scrub-rag which\n",

      "In a magazine devoted to advertising she had read that Mr. S. Herbert\n",

      "Gazette_, had been appointed advertising-manager for Pemberton's--the\n",
      "greatest manufactory of drugs and toilet articles in the world. Una had\n",
      "just been informed by Mr. Wilkins that, while he had an almost paternal\n",
      "desire to see her successful financially and otherwise, he could never\n",
      "pay her more than fifteen dollars a week. He used a favorite phrase of\n",
      "commuting captains of commerce: \"Personally, I'd be glad to pay you\n",
      "more, but fifteen is all the position is worth.\" She tried to persuade\n",
      "him that there is no position which cannot be made \"worth more.\" He\n",
      "promised to \"think it over.\" He was still taking a few months to think\n",
      "it over--while her Saturday pay-envelope remained as thin as ever--when\n",
      "Bessie Kraker resigned, to marry a mattress-renovator, and in Bessie's\n",
      "place Mr. Wilkins engaged a tall, beautiful blonde, who was too much of\n",
      "a lady to take orders from Una. This wrecked Una's little office home,\n",
      "and she was inspired to write to Mr. S. Herbert Ross at Pemberton's,\n",
      "telling him what a wise, good, noble, efficient man he was, and how much\n",
      "of a privilege it would be to become his secretary. She felt that Walter\n",
      "Babson must have been inexact in ever referring to Mr. Ross as \"Sherbet\n",
      "Souse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ross disregarded her letter for ten days, then so urgently\n",
      "telephoned her to come and see him that she took a taxicab clear to the\n",
      "Pemberton Building in Long Island City. After paying a week's lunch\n",
      "money for the taxicab, it was rather hard to discover why Mr. Ross had\n",
      "been quite so urgent. He rolled about his magnificent mahogany and\n",
      "tapestry office, looked out of the window at the Long Island Railroad\n",
      "tracks, and told her (in confidence) what fools all the _Gas Gazette_\n",
      "chiefs had been, and all his employers since then. She smiled\n",
      "appreciatively, and tried to get in a tactful remark about a position.\n",
      "She did discover that Mr. Ross had not as yet chosen his secretary at\n",
      "Pemberton's, but beyond this Una could find no evidence that he supposed\n",
      "her to have come for any reason other than to hear his mellow wisdom and\n",
      "even mellower stories.\n",

      "After more than a month, during which Mr. Ross diverted himself by\n",
      "making appointments, postponing them, forgetting them, telephoning,\n",
      "telegraphing, sending special-delivery letters, being paged at hotels,\n",
      "and doing all the useless melodramatic things he could think of, except\n",
      "using an aeroplane or a submarine, he decided to make her his secretary\n",
      "at twenty dollars a week. Two days later it occurred to him to test her\n",
      "in regard to speed in dictation and typing, and a few other minor things\n",
      "of the sort which her ability as a long-distance listener had made him\n",
      "overlook. Fortunately, she also passed this test.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she told Mr. Wilkins that she was going to leave, he used another\n",

      "learn these _clichés_ out of a little red-leather manual.... He\n",
      "tightened his lips and tapped on his desk-pad with a blue pencil; he\n",
      "looked grieved and said, touchingly: \"I think you're making a mistake. I\n",
      "was making plans for you; in fact, I had just about decided to offer you\n",
      "eighteen dollars a week, and to advance you just as fast as the business\n",
      "will warrant. I, uh, well, I think you're making a mistake in leaving a\n",

      "know anything about. I'm not in any way urging you to stay, you\n",
      "understand, but I don't like to see you making a mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had also told Bessie Kraker that she was \"making a mistake\" when\n",
      "she had resigned to be married, and he had been so very certain that Una\n",
      "could never be \"worth more\" than fifteen. Una was rather tart about it.\n",
      "Though Mr. Ross didn't want her at Pemberton's for two weeks more, she\n",

      "from a set of specifications, that he had his side in the perpetual\n",
      "struggle between ill-paid failure employers and ill-paid ambitious\n",

      "enough that soap-making was a perfectly natural phenomenon, could never\n",
      "get over marveling at the supernatural manner in which advertising\n",
      "seemed to create something out of nothing. It took a cherry fountain\n",
      "syrup which was merely a chemical imitation that under an old name was\n",
      "familiar to everybody; it gave the syrup a new name, and made twenty\n",

      "more Una felt the force of his attitude that he was a genius\n",
      "incomparable. She could not believe that he knew what a gorgeous fraud\n",
      "he was. On the same day, he received an advance in salary, discharged an\n",

      "while he was dictating. He was of an elegance in linen handkerchiefs, in\n",
      "a chased-gold cigarette-case, in cigarettes with a monogram. Indeed, he\n",
      "often stopped during dictation to lean across the enormous mahogany desk\n",

      "fly-casting, the ordering of small, smart dinners at the Plaza.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Ross was as full of ideas as of elegance. He gave birth to ideas at\n",
      "lunch, at \"conferences,\" while motoring, while being refreshed with a\n",
      "manicure and a violet-ray treatment at a barber-shop in the middle of\n",
      "one of his arduous afternoons. He would gallop back to the office with\n",
      "notes on these ideas, pant at Una in a controlled voice, \"Quick--your\n",

      "magazine advertisements, car cards, window-display \"cut-outs,\" and he\n",
      "dictated highly ethical reading matter for the house organ, which was\n",
      "distributed to ten thousand drug-stores, and which spoke well of\n",
      "honesty, feminine beauty, gardening, and Pemberton's. Occasionally he\n",

      "\n",
      "His office, which was like a million-dollar hotel lobby, and Una's own\n",
      "den, which was like the baggage-porter's den adjoining the same, were\n",
      "the only spots at Pemberton's where Una felt secure. Outside of them,\n",
      "fourteen stories up in the titanic factory, was an enormous\n",
      "office-floor, which was a wilderness of desks, toilet-rooms, elevators,\n",
      "waiting-rooms, filing-cabinets. Her own personality was absorbed in the\n",
      "cosmic (though soapy) personality of Pemberton's. Instead of longing for\n",
      "a change, she clung to her own corner, its desk and spring-back chair,\n",
      "and the insurance calendar with a high-colored picture of Washington's\n",
      "farewell. She preferred to rest here rather than in the \"club-room and\n",
      "rest-room for women employees,\" on which Mr. Pemberton so prided\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una heard rumors of rest-rooms which were really beautiful, really\n",
      "restful; but at Pemberton's the room resembled a Far Rockaway cottage\n",
      "rented by the week to feeble-minded bookkeepers. Musty it was, with\n",
      "curtains awry, and it must have been of use to all the branches of the\n",
      "Pemberton family in cleaning out their attics. Here was the old stuffed\n",
      "chair in which Pemberton I. had died, and the cot which had been in the\n",
      "cook's room till she had protested. The superstition among the chiefs\n",
      "was that all the women employees were very grateful for this charity.\n",
      "The room was always shown to exclamatory visitors, who told Mr.\n",
      "Pemberton that he was almost too good. But in secret conclaves at lunch\n",
      "the girls called the room \"the junk-shop,\" and said that they would\n",
      "rather go out and sit on the curb.\n",

      "near it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even had it been enticing, she would not have frequented it. Her\n",
      "caste as secretary forbade. For Pemberton's was as full of caste and\n",
      "politics as a Republican national convention; caste and politics,\n",
      "cliques and factions, plots and secrets, and dynasties that passed and\n",
      "were forgotten.\n",

      "to be with the firm for the rest of his life, and immediately afterward\n",
      "dictated a letter to the president of a rival firm in the effort to\n",
      "secure a new position. He destroyed the carbon copy of that letter and\n",
      "looked at Una as serenely as ever. Una saw him read letters on the\n",
      "desks of other chiefs while he was talking to them; saw him \"listen in\"\n",
      "on telephone calls, and casually thrust his foot into doors, in order to\n",
      "have a glimpse of the visitors in offices. She saw one of the younger\n",
      "Pembertons hide behind a bookcase while his father was talking to his\n",
      "brother. She knew that this Pemberton and Mr. Ross were plotting to oust\n",
      "the brother, and that the young, alert purchasing agent was trying to\n",
      "undermine them both. She knew that one of the girls in the private\n",
      "telephone exchange was the mistress and spy of old Pemberton. All of the\n",
      "chiefs tried to emulate the _moyen-age_ Italians in the arts of smiling\n",
      "poisoning--but they did it so badly; they were as fussily ineffectual as\n",
      "a group of school-boys who hate their teacher. Not \"big deals\" and vast\n",
      "grim power did they achieve, but merely a constant current of worried\n",
      "insecurity, and they all tended to prove Mrs. Lawrence's assertion that\n",
      "the office-world is a method of giving the largest possible number of\n",
      "people the largest possible amount of nervous discomfort, to the end of\n",
      "producing the largest possible quantity of totally useless articles....\n",
      "The struggle extended from the chiefs to the clerks; they who tramped up\n",
      "and down a corridor, waiting till a chief was alone, glaring at others\n",
      "who were also manoeuvering to see him; they who studied the lightest\n",
      "remark of any chief and rushed to allies with the problem of, \"Now, what\n",
      "did he mean by that, do you think?\"... A thousand questions of making an\n",
      "impression on the overlords, and of \"House Policy\"--that malicious\n",

      "people to refuse favors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una's share in the actual work at Pemberton's would have been only a\n",
      "morning's pastime, but her contact with the high-voltage current of\n",
      "politics exhausted her--and taught her that commercial rewards come to\n",
      "those who demand and take.\n",
      "\n",
      "The office politics bred caste. Caste at Pemberton's was as clearly\n",
      "defined as ranks in an army.\n",

      "At the top were the big chiefs, the officers of the company, and the\n",
      "heads of departments--Mr. Pemberton and his sons, the treasurer, the\n",

      "soda-fountain-syrup factory, of the soap-works, of the drug-laboratories,\n",
      "of the toilet-accessories shops, the sales-manager, and Mr. S. Herbert\n",

      "\"a cut-down in the force,\" every person on the office floor watched the\n",
      "chiefs as they assembled to go out to lunch together--big, florid,\n",
      "shaven, large-chinned men, talking easily, healthy from motoring and\n",
      "golf, able in a moment's conference at lunch to \"shift the policy\" and to\n",
      "bring instant poverty to the families of forty clerks or four hundred\n",
      "workmen in the shops. When they jovially entered the elevator together,\n",
      "some high-strung stenographer would rush over to one of the older women\n",
      "to weep and be comforted.... An hour from now her tiny job might be gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the chiefs' outside associates were tremendous, buyers and\n",
      "diplomatic representatives; big-chested men with watch-chains across\n",
      "their beautiful tight waistcoats. And like envoys extraordinary were the\n",
      "efficiency experts whom Mr. Pemberton occasionally had in to speed up\n",
      "the work a bit more beyond the point of human endurance.... One of these\n",
      "experts, a smiling and pale-haired young man who talked to Mr. Ross\n",
      "about the new poetry, arranged to have office-boys go about with trays\n",
      "of water-glasses at ten, twelve, two, and four. Thitherto, the\n",
      "stenographers had wasted a great deal of time in trotting to the battery\n",
      "of water-coolers, in actually being human and relaxed and gossipy for\n",
      "ten minutes a day. After the visitation of the expert the girls were so\n",
      "efficient that they never for a second stopped their work--except when\n",
      "one of them would explode in hysteria and be hurried off to the\n",
      "rest-room. But no expert was able to keep them from jumping at the\n",

      "efficient atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just beneath the chiefs was the caste of bright young men who would some\n",
      "day have the chance to be beatified into chiefs. They believed\n",
      "enormously in the virtue of spreading the blessings of Pemberton's\n",
      "patent medicines; they worshiped the house policy. Once a month they met\n",
      "at what they called \"punch lunches,\" and listened to electrifying\n",
      "addresses by Mr. S. Herbert Ross or some other inspirer, and turned\n",
      "fresh, excited eyes on one another, and vowed to adhere to the true\n",
      "faith of Pemberton's, and not waste their evenings in making love, or\n",
      "reading fiction, or hearing music, but to read diligently about soap and\n",
      "syrups and window displays, and to keep firmly before them the vision of\n",
      "fifteen thousand dollars a year. They had quite the best time of any one\n",
      "at Pemberton's, the bright young men. They sat, in silk shirts and new\n",
      "ties, at shiny, flat-topped desks in rows; they answered the telephone\n",
      "with an air; they talked about tennis and business conditions, and were\n",
      "never, never bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intermingled with this caste were the petty chiefs, the office-managers\n",
      "and bookkeepers, who were velvety to those placed in power over them,\n",
      "but twangily nagging to the girls and young men under them. Failures\n",
      "themselves, they eyed sourly the stenographers who desired two dollars\n",
      "more a week, and assured them that while _personally_ they would be\n",
      "_very_ glad to obtain the advance for them, it would be \"unfair to the\n",
      "other girls.\" They were very strong on the subject of not being unfair\n",
      "to the other girls, and their own salaries were based on \"keeping down\n",
      "overhead.\" Oldish men they were, wearing last-year hats and smoking\n",
      "Virginia cigarettes at lunch; always gossiping about the big chiefs, and\n",
      "at night disappearing to homes and families in New Jersey or Harlem.\n",
      "Awe-encircled as the very chiefs they appeared when they lectured\n",
      "stenographers, but they cowered when the chiefs spoke to them, and\n",
      "tremblingly fingered their frayed cuffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the castes above the buzzer-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una's caste, made up of private secretaries to the chiefs, was not above\n",
      "the buzzer. She had to leap to the rattlesnake tattoo, when Mr. Ross\n",
      "summoned her, as quickly as did the newest Jewish stenographer. But hers\n",
      "was a staff corps, small and exclusive and out of the regular line. On\n",
      "the one hand she could not associate with the chiefs; on the other, it\n",
      "was expected of her in her capacity as daily confidante to one of the\n",
      "gods, that she should not be friendly, in coat-room or rest-room or\n",
      "elevator, with the unrecognized horde of girls who merely copied or took\n",
      "the bright young men's dictation of letters to drug-stores. These girls\n",
      "of the common herd were expected to call the secretaries, \"Miss,\" no\n",
      "matter what street-corner impertinences they used to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no caste, though there was much factional rivalry, among the\n",
      "slaves beneath--the stenographers, copyists, clerks, waiting-room\n",
      "attendants, office-boys, elevator-boys. They were expected to keep clean\n",
      "and be quick-moving; beyond that they were as unimportant to the larger\n",
      "phases of office politics as frogs to a summer hotel. Only the\n",
      "cashier's card index could remember their names.... Though they were not\n",
      "deprived of the chief human satisfaction and vice--feeling superior. The\n",
      "most snuffle-nosed little mailing-girl on the office floor felt superior\n",
      "to all of the factory workers, even the foremen, quite as negro\n",
      "house-servants look down on poor white trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jealousy of position, cattishness, envy of social standing--these were\n",
      "as evident among the office-women as they are in a woman's club; and Una\n",
      "had to admit that woman's cruelty to woman often justified the\n",
      "prejudices of executives against the employment of women in business;\n",
      "that women were the worst foes of Woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Una's sympathies, the office proletarians were her own poor\n",
      "relations. She sighed over the cheap jackets, with silesia linings and\n",
      "raveled buttonholes, which nameless copyists tried to make attractive by\n",
      "the clean embroidered linen collars which they themselves laundered in\n",
      "wash-bowls in the evening. She discovered that even after years of\n",
      "experience with actual office-boys and elevator-boys, Mr. Ross still saw\n",
      "them only as slangy, comic-paper devils. Then, in the elevator, she\n",
      "ascertained that the runners made about two hundred trips up and down\n",
      "the dark chutes every day, and wondered if they always found it comic to\n",
      "do so. She saw the office-boys, just growing into the age of interest in\n",
      "sex and acquiring husky male voices and shambling sense of shame, yearn\n",
      "at the shrines of pasty-faced stenographers. She saw the humanity of all\n",
      "this mass--none the less that they envied her position and spoke privily\n",
      "of \"those snippy private secretaries that think they're so much sweller\n",
      "than the rest of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched with peculiar interest one stratum: the old ladies, the\n",
      "white-haired, fair-handed women of fifty and sixty and even seventy,\n",
      "spinsters and widows, for whom life was nothing but a desk and a job of\n",
      "petty pickings--mailing circulars or assorting letters or checking up\n",
      "lists. She watched them so closely because she speculated always, \"Will\n",
      "I ever be like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed comfortable; gossipy they were, and fond of mothering the\n",
      "girls. But now and then one of them would start to weep, cry for an hour\n",
      "together, with her white head on a spotty desk-blotter, till she forgot\n",
      "her homelessness and uselessness. Epidemics of hysteria would spring up\n",
      "sometimes, and women of thirty-five or forty--normally well\n",
      "content--would join the old ladies in sobbing. Una would wonder if she\n",
      "would be crying like that at thirty-five--and at sixty-five, with thirty\n",
      "barren, weeping years between. Always she saw the girls of twenty-two\n",
      "getting tired, the women of twenty-eight getting dry and stringy, the\n",
      "women of thirty-five in a solid maturity of large-bosomed and widowed\n",
      "spinsterhood, the old women purring and catty and tragic.... She herself\n",
      "was twenty-eight now, and she knew that she was growing sallow, that the\n",
      "back of her neck ached more often, and that she had no release in sight\n",
      "save the affably dull Mr. Julius Edward Schwirtz.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machines were the Pemberton force, and their greatest rivals were the\n",
      "machines of steel and wood, at least one of which each new efficiency\n",
      "expert left behind him: Machines for opening letters and sealing them,\n",
      "automatic typewriters, dictation phonographs, pneumatic chutes. But none\n",
      "of the other machines was so tyrannical as the time-clock. Una admitted\n",
      "to herself that she didn't see how it was possible to get so many\n",
      "employees together promptly without it, and she was duly edified by the\n",
      "fact that the big chiefs punched it, too.... But she noticed that after\n",

      "She knew that the machines were supposed to save work. But she was aware\n",
      "that the girls worked just as hard and long and hopelessly after their\n",

      "revolution in the attitude toward them. She saw that the comfortable\n",
      "average men of the office sooner or later, if they were but faithful and\n",
      "lived long enough, had opportunities, responsibility, forced upon them.\n",
      "No such force was used upon the comfortable average women!\n",

      "She endeavored to picture a future in which women, the ordinary,\n",
      "philoprogenitive, unambitious women, would have some way out besides\n",

      "fundamental purpose of organized business from the increased production\n",
      "of soap--or books or munitions--to the increased production of\n",
      "happiness. How this revolution was to be accomplished she had but little\n",
      "more notion than the other average women in business. She blindly\n",

      "old-age pensions, through scientific mosquito-slaying and cancer-curing\n",
      "and food reform and the abolition of anarchistic business competition,\n",
      "to a goal of tolerable and beautiful life. Of one thing she was sure:\n",
      "This age, which should adjudge happiness to be as valuable as soap or\n",

      "nerves to the effect that they lived in a polite version of hell.... She\n",
      "was more and more certain that the workers weren't discontented enough;\n",
      "that they were too patient with lives insecure and tedious. But she\n",
      "refused to believe that the age of comparative happiness would always be\n",
      "a dream; for already, at Herzfeld & Cohn's she had tasted of an\n",

      "where it was not a crime to laugh easily. But certainly she did not\n",
      "expect to see this age during her own life. She and her fellows were\n",
      "doomed, unless they met by chance with marriage or death; or unless they\n",

      "was coming the two women had an early and quick dinner of cold ham and\n",
      "canned soup, and hastily got out the electric iron to press a frock;\n",
      "produced Pemberton's Flesh-Tinted Vanisho Powder, and the lip-stick\n",
      "whose use Una hated, but which she needed more and more as she came back\n",

      "Poor Una! She was thinking now, secretly and shamefacedly, of the\n",

      "Pemberton's cold-cream. She cold-creamed and massaged her face every\n",
      "night, standing wearily before a milky mirror in the rather close and\n",
      "lingerie-scattered bedroom, solemnly rotating her fingers about her\n",
      "cheeks and forehead, stopping to conjecture that the pores in her nose\n",
      "were getting enlarged. She rubbed her hair with Pemberton's \"Olivine and\n",
      "Petrol\" to keep it from growing thin, and her neck with cocoanut oil to\n",

      "Mr. Schwirtz was tireless and extravagant and hearty at the Champs du\n",

      "ecstasy in the Oriental pride of a superb Jewess who was singing to the\n",

      "momentary pang of distrust healed by the brotherly talk of the\n",
      "broad-shouldered man who cared for her and nimbly fulfilled her every\n",
      "whim. An unvoiced desire to keep him from drinking so many highballs; an\n",
      "enduring thankfulness to him when she was back at the flat; a defiant\n",
      "joy that he had kissed her good-night--just once, and so tenderly; a\n",

      "hearing Mr. S. Herbert Ross pluck out his vest-pocket harp and hymn his\n",

      "from high gardens of moonlight to the reality of the flat, where\n",
      "Lawrence was breathing loudly in her sleep; the oily smell of hairs\n",
      "tangled in her old hair-brush; the sight of the alarm-clock which in\n",
      "just six hours would be flogging her off to the mill. A sudden,\n",
      "frightened query as to what scornful disdain Walter Babson would fling\n",
      "at her if he saw her glorying in this Broadway circus with the heavy Mr.\n",
      "Schwirtz. A ghostly night-born feeling that she still belonged to\n",
      "Walter, living or dead, and a wonder as to where in all the world he\n",
      "might be. A defiant protest that she idealized Walter, that he wasn't so\n",
      "awfully superior to the Champs du Pom-Pom as this astral body of his was\n",
      "pretending, and a still more defiant gratitude to Mr. Schwirtz as she\n",

      "Her old enemy, routine, was constantly in the field. Routine of taking\n",

      "But in the splendor of being independent again and of having something\n",

      "By contrast with two years of hours either empty or filled with\n",

      "that some of the men she met were Schwirtzes to their wives, but to her\n",

      "planes above ordinary humanity, were desirable or necessary parts of the\n",
      "life at Truax & Fein's. Here, too, she saw nine hours of daily strain\n",
      "aging slim girls into skinny females. But now her whole point of view\n",
      "was changed. Instead of looking for the evils of the business world, she\n",
      "was desirous of seeing in it all the blessings she could; and, without\n",
      "ever losing her belief that it could be made more friendly, she was,\n",
      "nevertheless, able to rise above her own personal weariness and see that\n",
      "the world of jobs, offices, business, had made itself creditably\n",
      "superior to those other muddled worlds of politics and amusement and\n",
      "amorous Schwirtzes. She believed again, as in commercial college she had\n",
      "callowly believed, that business was beginning to see itself as\n",

      "across the long, carmine stain, air sweet and cool, and the\n",
      "yellow-lighted windows of other skyscrapers giving distant\n",

      "The mist of newness had passed, that confusion of the recent arrival in\n",

      "than Mr. Pemberton. The Real Estate Board of Trade was impressed by his\n",
      "unsmiling insistence on the Dignity of the Profession, and always asked\n",
      "him to serve on committees. It was Mr. Truax who bought the property for\n",

      "\n",
      "There was the super-chief, the one person related to the firm whom Una\n",
      "hated--Mrs. D. T. Truax. She was not officially connected with the\n",
      "establishment, and her office habits were irregular. Mostly they\n",
      "consisted in appearing at the most inconvenient hours and asking\n",
      "maddening questions. She was fat, massaged, glittering, wheezy-voiced,\n",
      "nagging. Una peculiarly hated Mrs. Truax's nails. Una's own finger-tips\n",
      "were hard with typing; her manicuring was a domestic matter of clipping\n",
      "and hypocritical filing. But to Mrs. Truax manicuring was a life-work.\n",
      "Because of much clipping of the cuticle, the flesh at the base of each\n",
      "nail had become a noticeably raised cushion of pink flesh. Her nails\n",
      "were too pink, too shiny, too shapely, and sometimes they were an\n",
      "unearthly white at the ends, because of nail-paste left under them. At\n",
      "that startling whiteness Una stared all the while Mrs. Truax was tapping\n",
      "her fingers and prying into the private morals of the pretty hall-girl,\n",

      "Collating Mrs. Truax and the matrons of the Visiting Board of the\n",

      "views to young women on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting figure in the office was Mr. Fein, the junior\n",

      "Serious, tall, spectacled, clean-shaven, lean-faced, taking business as\n",
      "a profession, and kindly justice as a religion, studying efficiency, but\n",
      "hating the metamorphosis of clerks into machines, he was the distinction\n",
      "and the power of Truax & Fein. At first Una had thought him humorless\n",
      "and negligible, but she discovered that it was he who pulled Mr. Truax\n",
      "out of his ruts, his pious trickeries, his cramping economies. She found\n",
      "that Mr. Fein loved books and the opera, and that he could be boyish\n",

      "satisfied conformation to a life of marble floors and artificial light\n",

      "loyalty as is supposed to distinguish all young aspirants--loyalty which\n",
      "is so well spoken of by bosses, and which is so generally lacking among\n",
      "the bossed. Partly, this was her virtue, partly it was the firm's, and\n",
      "partly it was merely the accident of her settling down.\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched the biological growth of Truax & Fein with fascination; was\n",
      "excited when they opened a new subdivision, and proudly read the\n",
      "half-page advertisements thereof in the Sunday newspapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That loyalty made her study real estate, not merely stenography; for to\n",
      "most stenographers their work is the same whether they take dictation\n",
      "regarding real estate, or book-publishing, or felt slippers, or the\n",
      "removal of taconite. They understand transcription, but not what they\n",
      "transcribe. She read magazines--_System_, _Printer's Ink_, _Real Estate\n",
      "Record_ (solemnly studying \"Recorded Conveyances,\" and \"Plans Filed for\n",
      "New Construction Work,\" and \"Mechanics' Liens\"). She got ideas for\n",
      "houses from architectural magazines, garden magazines, women's\n",
      "magazines. But what most indicated that she was a real devotee was the\n",
      "fact that, after glancing at the front-page headlines, the society news,\n",
      "and the joke column in her morning paper, she would resolutely turn to\n",
      "\"The Real Estate Field.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sundays she often led Mr. Schwirtz for a walk among the new suburban\n",
      "developments.... For always, no matter what she did at the office, no\n",
      "matter how much Mr. Truax depended on her or Mr. Fein praised her, she\n",
      "went home to the same cabbage-rose-carpeted housekeeping-room, and to a\n",
      "Mr. Schwirtz who had seemingly not stirred an inch since she had left\n",
      "him in the morning.... Mr. Schwirtz was of a harem type, and not much\n",
      "adapted to rustic jaunting, but he obediently followed his master and\n",
      "tried to tell stories of the days when he had known all about real\n",
      "estate, while she studied model houses, the lay of the land, the lines\n",
      "of sewers and walks.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was loyalty to Truax & Fein as much as desire for advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that same loyalty made her accept as fellow-workers even the\n",
      "noisiest of the salesmen--and even Beatrice Joline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Mr. Truax didn't \"believe in\" women salesmen, one woman briskly\n",
      "overrode his beliefs: Miss Beatrice Joline, of the Gramercy Park\n",
      "Jolines, who cheerfully called herself \"one of the _nouveau pauvre_,\"\n",
      "and condescended to mere Upper West Side millionaires, and had to earn\n",
      "her frocks and tea money. She earned them, too; but she declined to be\n",
      "interested in office regulations or office hours. She sold suburban\n",
      "homes as a free lance, and only to the very best people. She darted into\n",
      "the office now and then, slender, tall, shoulder-swinging, an\n",
      "exclamation-point of a girl, in a smart, check suit and a Bendel hat.\n",
      "She ignored Una with a coolness which reduced her to the status of a new\n",

      "property-owner to part with a Long Island estate for approximately\n",

      "hundred lots, Miss Joline had to wait. She perched on Una's desk,\n",
      "outside Mr. Truax's door, swung her heels, inspected the finger-ends of\n",

      "While unconscious that a secretary in a tabby-gray dress and gold\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, it's a very nice name,\" she said. \"Fancy being called Joline.\n",

      "treatise regarding a commonplace woman on a job, and at the Gardens\n",
      "there was no job at all, but one long summer day of flushed laughter. It\n",
      "is true that \"values were down on the North Shore\" at this period, and\n",
      "sales slow; it is true that Una (in high tan boots and a tweed suit from\n",

      "as local office and dwelling-place for herself. It is true that she\n",
      "quarreled with the engineer planning the walks and sewers, usurped\n",
      "authority and discharged him, and had to argue with Mr. Truax for three\n",
      "hours before he sustained her decision. Also, she spent an average of\n",
      "nine hours a day in waiting for people or in showing them about, and\n",
      "serving tea and biscuits to dusty female villa-hunters. And she herself\n",
      "sometimes ran a lawn-mower and cooked her own meals. But she had\n",
      "respect, achievement, and she ranged the open hills from the stirring\n",
      "time when dogwood blossoms filled the ravines with a fragrant mist,\n",
      "round the calendar, and on till the elms were gorgeous with a second\n",
      "autumn, and sunsets marched in naked glory of archangels over the\n",
      "Connecticut hills beyond the flaming waters of Long Island Sound.\n",
      "Slow-moving, but gentle, were the winter months, for she became a part\n",
      "of the commuting town of Crosshampton Harbor, not as the negligible\n",
      "daughter of a Panama Captain Golden, but as a woman with the glamour of\n",
      "independence, executive position, city knowledge, and a certain marital\n",
      "mystery. She was invited to parties at which she obediently played\n",
      "bridge, to dances at the Harbor Yacht Club, to meetings of the Village\n",
      "Friendly Society. A gay, easy-going group, with cocktail-mixers on their\n",
      "sideboards, and motors in their galvanized-iron garages, but also with\n",
      "savings-bank books in the drawers beneath their unit bookcases, took her\n",
      "up as a woman who had learned to listen and smile. And she went with\n",
      "them to friendly, unexacting dances at the Year-Round Inn, conducted by\n",
      "Charley Duquesne, in the impoverished Duquesne mansion on Smiley Point.\n",
      "She liked Charley, and gave him advice about bedroom chintzes for the\n",

      "Mr. Truax still \"didn't believe in\" women salesmen, and his lack of\n",
      "faith was more evident now that Una was back in the office. Una grew\n",
      "more pessimistic as she realized that his idea of women salesmen was a\n",
      "pure, high, aloof thing which wasn't to be affected by anything\n",
      "happening in his office right under his nose. But she was too busy\n",
      "selling lots, instructing her women aides, and furnishing a four-room\n",
      "flat near Stuyvesant Park, to worry much about Mr. Truax. And she was\n",
      "sure that Mr. Fein would uphold her. She had the best of reasons for\n",

      "proposal for her hand in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had refused him for two reasons--that she already had one husband\n",
      "somewhere or other, and the more cogent reason that though she admired\n",

      "evening, she did not love him, did not want to mother him, as she had\n",
      "always wanted to mother Walter Babson, and as, now and then, when he had\n",

      "\n",
      "The incident brought Mr. Schwirtz to her mind for a day or two. But he\n",

      "did not know, and did not often speculate, whether he lived or continued\n",
      "to die. If the world is very small, after all, it is also very large,\n",

      "for orders, she would somehow be a different person from the good\n",
      "little secretary. She was astonished to find that in her private office\n",

      "responsible to her at times, though she found it difficult to secure\n",

      "\n",
      "She was able to work out some of the aspirations she had cloudily\n",

      "of intimacy with them, to confide in them instead of tricking them, to\n",
      "use frank explanations instead of arbitrary rules; and she was rewarded\n",

      "\n",
      "The idea seemed good to her. She fancied that traveling-men would go\n",

      "precisely what details made it the favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stayed at two or three places a day for at least one meal--hotels in\n",
      "tiny towns she had never heard of, and in larger towns that were\n",
      "fumbling for metropolitanism. She sought out all the summer resorts that\n",
      "were open so early. She talked to travelers, men and women; to\n",
      "hack-drivers and to grocers supplying hotels; to proprietors and their\n",
      "wives; to clerks and waitresses and bell-boys, and unconsidered,\n",

      "Take out desks--guests to register and pay bills in small office off\n",

      "make pleasant room with miserable old 'desk' sticking out into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(2) Cut out the cuspidors. Have special room where drummers can play\n",
      "cards and tell stories and _spit_. Allow smoking in 'office,' but make\n",
      "it pleasant. Rem. chintz and wicker chairs at $3 each. Small round\n",
      "tables with reading-lamps. Maybe fireplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(3) Better pastry and soup and keep coffee up to standard. One surprise\n",
      "in each meal--for example, novel form of eggs, good salad, or canned\n",
      "lobster cocktail. Rem. the same old pork, beans, cornbeef, steak, deadly\n",
      "cold boiled potato everywhere I went.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(4) More attractive dining-rooms. Esp. small tables for 2 and 4. Cater\n",
      "more to local customers with à la carte menus--not long but good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(5) Women housekeepers and pay 'em good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(6) Hygienic kitchens and advertise 'em.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(7) Train employees, as rem. trav. man told me United Cigar Stores do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(8) Better accom. for women. Rem. several traveling men's wives told me\n",
      "they would go on many trips w. husbands if they could get decent hotels\n",
      "in all these towns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(9) Not ape N. Y. hotels. Nix on gilt and palms and marble. But clean\n",

      "AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, wife,\" said Mr. Benjamin Stanton, as he sat down to a late\n",
      "breakfast, \"I had a letter from Ohio yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From Ohio? Who should write you from Ohio? Anyone I know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My sister, Margaret, you remember, moved out there with her husband ten\n",
      "years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's from her, is it?\" said Mrs. Stanton, indifferently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said her husband with momentary gravity. \"It's from a Dr. Kent,\n",
      "who attended her in her last illness. Margaret is dead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" returned Mrs. Stanton, uncomfortably; \"and I am just out of\n",
      "mourning for my aunt. Do you think it will be necessary for us to go\n",
      "into mourning for your sister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I think not,\" said her husband. \"Margaret has lived away from us so\n",
      "long, and people won't know that we have had a death in the family\n",
      "unless we mention it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was that all the letter said--about the death, I mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, no,\" said Mr. Stanton, with a little frown. \"It seems Margaret\n",
      "left a child--a boy of fourteen; and, as she left no property, the\n",
      "doctor suggests that I should send for the boy and assume the care of\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word!\" said Mrs. Stanton; \"you will find yourself in business\n",
      "if you undertake to provide for all the beggars' brats that apply to you\n",
      "for assistance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must remember that you are speaking of my sister's child,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Stanton, who, cold and selfish and worldly as he was, had some touch of\n",
      "decency about him, and did not relish the term \"beggars' brats,\" as\n",
      "applied to one so nearly related to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, call him what you like,\" said his wife; \"only don't be so foolish\n",
      "as to go spending your money on him when our children need all we have.\n",
      "There's Maria needs a new dress immediately. She says all the girls at\n",
      "Signor Madalini's dancing academy dress elegantly, and she's positively\n",
      "ashamed to appear in any of her present dresses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much will it cost?\" asked Mr. Stanton, opening his pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may hand me seventy-five dollars. I think I can make that do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a word of remonstrance, the money was placed in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want some money, too,\" said Tom Stanton, who had just disposed of a\n",
      "very hearty meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want it for, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, some of the fellows are getting up a club. It's going to be a\n",
      "select affair, and of course each of us has got to contribute some\n",
      "money. You see, we are going to hire a room, furnish it nicely with a\n",
      "carpet, black walnut furniture, and so on, and that'll cost something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose idea is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Sam Paget was the first boy that mentioned it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose son is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His father belongs to the firm of Paget, Norwood & Co. He's awful\n",
      "rich.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is one of our first families,\" said Mr. Stanton, with\n",
      "satisfaction. \"Is he a friend of yours, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, we are quit intimate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right!\" said his father, approvingly. \"I am glad you choose your\n",
      "friends so well. That's one of the principal reasons I have for sending\n",
      "you to an expensive school, to get you well launched into good society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, father, I understand,\" said Tom. \"You won't find me associating\n",
      "with common boys. I hold my head a little too high for that, I can tell\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right, my boy,\" said Mr. Stanton, with satisfaction. \"And now\n",
      "how much money do you want for this club of yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Tom, hesitatingly, \"thirty or forty dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that considerable?\" said his father, surprised at the amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you see, father, I want to contribute as much as any of the boys.\n",
      "It would seem mean if I didn't. There's only a few of us to stand the\n",
      "expense, and we don't want to let in any out of our own set.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true,\" said Mr. Stanton; \"I approve of that. It's all very well\n",
      "to talk about democracy, but I believe in those of the higher orders\n",
      "keeping by themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you'll give the money, father?\" said Tom, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Tom, there's forty dollars. It's more than I ought to spare, but I\n",
      "am determined you shall stand as good a chance as any of your school-\n",
      "fellows. They shan't be able to say that your father stints you in\n",
      "anything that your position requires.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, father,\" said Tom, pocketing the two twenty-dollar bills\n",
      "with great satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact was that Tom's assessment amounted to only twenty dollars, but\n",
      "he thought it would be a good excuse for getting more out of his father.\n",
      "As to the extra money, Tom felt confident that he could find uses enough\n",
      "for it. He had latterly, though but fourteen years of age, contracted\n",
      "the habit of smoking cigars; a habit which he found rather expensive,\n",
      "especially as he felt bound occasionally to treat his companions. Then\n",
      "he liked, now and then, to drop in and get an ice-cream or some\n",
      "confectionery, and these little expenses counted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton was a vain, worldly man. He was anxious to obtain an\n",
      "entrance into the best society. For this reason, he made it a point to\n",
      "send his children to the most expensive schools; trusting to their\n",
      "forming fashionable acquaintances, through whom his whole family might\n",
      "obtain recognition into those select circles for which he cherished a\n",
      "most undemocratic respect. For this reason it was that, though not\n",
      "naturally liberal, he had opened his purse willingly at the demands of\n",
      "Mrs. Stanton and Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Stanton, after Tom's little financial affair had been\n",
      "adjusted, \"what are you going to write to this doctor? Of course you\n",
      "won't think of sending for your nephew?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By no means. He is much better off where he is. I shall write Dr. Kent\n",
      "that he is old enough to earn his own living, and I shall recommend that\n",
      "he be bound out to some farmer or mechanic in the neighborhood. It is an\n",
      "imposition to expect, because I am tolerably well off, that it is my\n",
      "duty to support other people's children. My own are entitled to all I\n",
      "can do for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so, father,\" said Tom, who was ready enough to give his consent\n",
      "to any proposition of a selfish nature. \"Charity begins at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With Tom, by the way, it not only began at home, but it ended there, and\n",
      "the same may be said of his father. From time to time Mr. Stanton's name\n",
      "was found in the list of donors to some charitable object, provided his\n",
      "benevolence was likely to obtain sufficient publicity, Mr. Stanton did\n",
      "not believe in giving in secret. What was the use of giving away money\n",
      "unless you could get credit for it? That was the principle upon which he\n",
      "always acted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose,\" continued Tom, \"this country cousin of mine wears cowhide\n",
      "boots and overalls, and has got rough, red hands like a common laborer.\n",
      "I wonder what Sam Paget would say if I should introduce such a fellow to\n",
      "him as my cousin. I rather guess he would not want to be quite so\n",
      "intimate with me as he is now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If anything had been needed, this consideration would have been\n",
      "sufficient to deter Mr. Stanton from sending for his nephew. He could\n",
      "not permit the social standing of his family to be compromised by the\n",
      "presence of a poor relation from the country, rough and unpolished as he\n",
      "doubtless was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maria, too, who had been for some time silent, here contributed to\n",
      "strengthen the effect of Tom's words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said she, \"and Laura Brooks, my most intimate friend, who is\n",
      "shocked at anything vulgar or countrified--I wouldn't have her know that\n",
      "I have such a cousin--oh, not for the world!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There will be no occasion for it,\" said her father, decidedly. \"I shall\n",
      "write at once to this Dr. Kent, explaining to him my views and wishes,\n",
      "and how impossible it is for me to do as he so inconsiderately\n",
      "suggests.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the wisest thing you can do, Mr. Stanton,\" said his wife, who was\n",
      "to the full as selfish as her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is his name, father?\" asked Maria.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The boy's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert Mason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert? I thought it might be Jonathan, or Zeke, or some such name.\n",
      "Herbert isn't at all countrified.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Tom, slyly; \"of course not. We all know why you like that\n",
      "name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you're mighty wise, Mr. Tom!\" retorted his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's because you like Herbert Dartmouth; but it isn't any use. He's in\n",
      "love with Lizzie Graves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to know all about it,\" said Maria, with vexation; for Tom was\n",
      "not far from right in speaking of her preference for Herbert Dartmouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I do,\" said Tom; \"I ought to, for he told me so himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe it!\" said Maria, who looked ready to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you needn't; but it's so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be quiet, children,\" said Mrs. Stanton. \"Thomas, you mustn't plague\n",
      "your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't take it so hard, Maria,\" said Tom, in rather an aggravating tone.\n",
      "\"There's other boys you could get. I guess you could get Jim Gorham for\n",
      "a beau, if you tried hard enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't have him,\" said Maria. \"His face is all over freckles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Enough of this quarreling, children,\" said Mrs. Stanton. \"I hope,\" she\n",
      "continued, addressing her husband, \"you won't fail to write at once.\n",
      "They might be sending on the boy, and then we should be in a pretty\n",
      "predicament.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will write at once. I don't know but I ought to inclose some money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see why you need to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I had better, as this is the last I intend to do for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any rate, it won't be necessary to send much,\" said Mrs. Stanton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five dollars will do, I should think. Because he happens to be your\n",
      "nephew, there is no good reason why he should be thrown upon you for\n",
      "support.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it will be best to send ten dollars,\" said Mr. Stanton. \"People\n",
      "are unreasonable, you know, and they might charge me with meanness, if I\n",
      "sent less.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then make it ten. It's only for once. I hope that will be the last we\n",
      "shall hear of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The room in which this conversation took place was a handsomely\n",
      "furnished breakfast room, all the appointments of which spoke not only\n",
      "of comfort, but of luxury. Mr. Stanton had been made rich by a series of\n",
      "lucky speculations, and he was at present carrying on a large wholesale\n",
      "store downtown. He had commenced with small means twenty years before,\n",
      "and for some years had advanced slowly, until the tide of fortune set in\n",
      "and made him rich. His present handsome residence he had only occupied\n",
      "three years, having moved to it from one of much smaller pretensions on\n",
      "Bleecker Street. Tom and Maria were forbidden to speak of their former\n",
      "home to their present fashionable acquaintances, and this prohibition\n",
      "they were likely to observe, having inherited to the full the worldly\n",
      "spirit which actuated their parents. It will be seen that Herbert Mason\n",
      "was little likely to be benefited by having such prosperous relations.\n",

      "INTRODUCING THE HERO\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If my young readers do not find the town of Waverley on the map of Ohio,\n",
      "they may conclude that it was too small to attract the notice of the\n",
      "map-makers. The village is small, consisting of about a dozen houses, a\n",
      "church, a schoolhouse, and, as a matter of course, one of that well-\n",
      "known class of stores in which everything required for the family is\n",
      "sold, from a dress-pattern to a pound of sugar. Outside of the village\n",
      "there are farmhouses, surrounded by broad acres, which keep them at\n",
      "respectable distances from each other, like the feudal castles of the\n",
      "Middle Ages. The land is good, and the farmers are thrifty and well-to-\n",
      "do; but probably the whole town contains less than a thousand\n",
      "inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the houses, near the church, lived Dr. Kent, whose letter has\n",
      "already been referred to. He was a skillful physician, and a very worthy\n",
      "man, who would have been very glad to be benevolent if his limited\n",
      "practice had supplied him with the requisite means. But chance had\n",
      "directed him to a healthy and sparsely-settled neighborhood, where he\n",
      "was able only to earn a respectable livelihood, and indeed found himself\n",
      "compelled to economize at times where he would have liked to indulge\n",
      "himself in expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Mason died it was found that the sale of her furniture barely\n",
      "realized enough to defray the expenses of her funeral. Herbert, her only\n",
      "son, was left wholly unprovided for. Dr. Kent, knowing that he had a\n",
      "rich uncle in New York, undertook to communicate to him the position in\n",
      "which his nephew had been left, never doubting that he would cheerfully\n",
      "extend a helping hand to him. Meanwhile he invited Herbert to come to\n",
      "his house and make it his home till his uncle should send for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was a handsome, well-grown boy of fourteen, and a general\n",
      "favorite in the village. While his mother lived he had done all he could\n",
      "to lighten her tasks, and he grieved deeply for her loss now that she\n",
      "was gone. His father had ten years before failed in business in the city\n",
      "of New York, and, in a fit of depression, had emigrated to this obscure\n",
      "country village, where he had invested the few hundred dollars remaining\n",
      "to him in a farm, from which he was able to draw a scanty income. Being\n",
      "a man of liberal education, he had personally superintended the\n",
      "education of his son till his death, two years before, so that Herbert's\n",
      "attainments were considerably in advance of those of other boys of his\n",
      "age in the neighborhood. He knew something of Latin and French, which\n",
      "made him looked upon as quite a model of learning by his playmates.\n",
      "After his father's death he had continued the daily study of the\n",
      "languages, so that he was able to read ordinary French with nearly as\n",
      "much ease as if it were English. Though studious, he was not a bookworm,\n",
      "but was distinguished in athletic sports popular with boys of his age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough has been said of our hero by way of introduction. Herbert's\n",
      "faults and virtues will appear as the record of his adventures is\n",
      "continued. It may be hinted only that, while he was frank, manly, and\n",
      "generous in his disposition, he was proud and high-spirited also, and\n",
      "perhaps these qualities were sometimes carried to excess. He would not\n",
      "allow himself to be imposed upon if he could help it. Being strong for\n",
      "his age, he was always able to maintain his rights, but never abused his\n",
      "strength by making it the instrument of tyrannizing over weaker boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Herbert felt somewhat anxious as to his future prospects. He\n",
      "knew that the doctor had written to his Uncle Benjamin about him, and he\n",
      "hoped that he might be sent for to New York, having a great curiosity to\n",
      "see the city, of which he had heard so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you heard from my uncle, Dr. Kent?\" he inquired, a few days after\n",
      "the scene recorded in our first chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "His question was prompted by seeing the doctor coming into the yard with\n",
      "an open letter in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dr. Kent, with troubled expression and perplexed took.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does Uncle Benjamin say?\" asked our young hero, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing very encouraging, Herbert, I am sorry to say,\" returned the\n",
      "doctor. \"However, here is the letter; you may read it for yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert received the letter from the doctor's hands and read it through\n",
      "with feelings of mortification and anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"DEAR SIR: I have to acknowledge yours of the 10th inst. I regret to\n",
      "hear of my sister's decease. I regret, also, to hear that her son,\n",
      "Herbert, is left without a provision for his support. My brother-in-law\n",

      "admiring the independent spirit which would not allow him to accept the\n",
      "proffered money, except as a loan. But mingled with his shame was a\n",
      "feeling of relief, as he foresaw that Herbert's pride would not suffer\n",
      "him to become a burden upon him in the future. He hardly expected ever\n",

      "A COLLISION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a week later when an incident befell Herbert which is worthy of\n",
      "mention, since it brought him into collision with a man who was destined\n",
      "to have some influence over his future life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A neighboring farmer, for whom, during his mother's life, he had\n",
      "occasionally gone on errands, drove up in front of the doctor's house,\n",
      "and asked Herbert if he could take his horse and wagon and drive over to\n",
      "the mill village to get some corn ground. Herbert was rather glad to\n",
      "accept this proposal, not only because he was to receive twenty-five\n",
      "cents for so doing, but also because he was fond of driving a horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was only about a mile from the mill village, when he saw approaching\n",
      "him a man in a light open buggy. Herbert knew every horse in Waverley,\n",
      "and every man, woman, and child, for that matter, and he perceived at\n",
      "once that the driver was a stranger. To tell the truth, he was not very\n",
      "favorably impressed by his appearance. The man was very dark, with black\n",
      "hair and an unshaven beard of three days' growth, which did not set off\n",
      "his irregular and repulsive features. His mouth, partly open, revealed\n",
      "several yellow tusks, stained with tobacco juice. On his head he wore a\n",
      "broad-brimmed straw hat, rather the worse for wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that just at this point the middle of the road was much\n",
      "better than the sides, which sloped considerably, terminating in gullies\n",
      "which were partly full from the recent rains. The road was narrow, being\n",
      "wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other, if each veered to the\n",
      "side, but not otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert observed that the buggy, which was now rapidly approaching, was\n",
      "kept in the center of the road, and that the driver appeared to have no\n",
      "intention of turning out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does he mean?\" thought our hero. \"He cannot expect me to do the\n",
      "whole of the turning out. I will turn out my half, and if he wants to\n",
      "get by, he must do the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, he turned partially to one side, as much as could be\n",
      "reasonably expected, and quietly awaited the approach of the man in the\n",
      "buggy. The latter still kept the center of the road, and did not turn\n",
      "out his carriage at all. As soon as it was close at hand, the driver\n",
      "leaned forward and exclaimed angrily:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Turn out, boy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If he expected that Herbert would be intimidated by his tone he was much\n",
      "mistaken. Our hero was bold, and not easily frightened. He looked\n",
      "quietly in the man's face, and said composedly, \"I have turned out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then turn out more, you young vagabond! Do you hear me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, I hear you, and should if you didn't speak half so loud.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curse your impudence! I tell you, turn out more!\" exclaimed the\n",
      "stranger, becoming more and more angry. He had expected to get his own\n",
      "way without trouble. If Herbert had been a man, he would not have been\n",
      "so unreasonable; but he supposed he could browbeat a boy into doing\n",
      "whatever he chose to dictate. But he had met his match, as it turned\n",
      "out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already given you half the road,\" said Herbert, firmly, \"and I\n",
      "don't intend to give you any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't, eh? Young man, how old are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am fourteen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think you were forty by the airs you put on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it putting on airs to insist on my rights?\" asked our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your rights!\" retorted the other, laughing contemptuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my rights,\" returned Herbert, quietly. \"I have a right to half of\n",
      "the road, and I have taken it. If I turn out any more, I shall go into\n",
      "the gully.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That makes no difference. A wetting won't do you any harm. Your\n",
      "impudence needs cooling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That may be,\" said Herbert, who did not choose to get angry, but was\n",
      "resolved to maintain his rights; \"but I object to the wetting, for all\n",
      "that, and as this wagon is not mine, I do not choose to upset it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are the most insolent young scamp I ever came across!\" exclaimed\n",
      "the other, furiously. \"I've a good mind to give you something much worse\n",
      "than a wetting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such as what?\" asked our hero, coolly. In reply the man flourished his\n",
      "whip significantly. \"Do you see that?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" said the other, ironically; \"I'm glad you do. Perhaps\n",
      "you wouldn't like to feel it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't think I should,\" said Herbert, not exhibiting the least\n",
      "apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger handled his whip, eyeing our hero viciously at the same\n",
      "time, as if it would have afforded him uncommon pleasure to lay it over\n",
      "his back. But there was something in the look of our hero which\n",
      "unconsciously cowed him, and, much as he wished to strike him, he held\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you're a cool hand,\" he said, after a moment's hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this our hero did not see fit to make any reply. But he grasped his\n",
      "own whip a little tighter. So brutal had been the tone assumed by the\n",
      "stranger, that he was not sure but he might proceed to carry out his\n",
      "threat, and lay the whip over his back. He determined, in that case, to\n",
      "give him as good as he sent. I will not express any opinion as to the\n",
      "propriety of this determination, but I am certain, from what I know of\n",
      "our hero's fearless spirit, that he would not have hesitated to do it,\n",
      "be the consequences what they might. But he did not have the\n",
      "opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once more,\" demanded the stranger, furiously; \"are you going to turn\n",
      "out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the boy, decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then--I'll run you down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he brought the whip violently on the horse's back. The latter\n",
      "gave a convulsive spring forward. But his driver had not taken into\n",
      "consideration that the farm-wagon was the stronger of the two vehicles,\n",
      "and that in any collision the buggy must come off second best. So it\n",
      "happened that a wheel of the buggy was broken, and the driver, in the\n",
      "shock, thrown sprawling into a puddle on the other side of the road. The\n",
      "wagon suffered no damage, but the old horse, terrified, set off at a\n",
      "rapid pace. Herbert looked back to see if the stranger was injured, but\n",
      "seeing that he had already picked himself up unwounded, but decidedly\n",
      "dirty, he concluded to keep on his way to the mill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driver of the overturned vehicle was considerably more angry than\n",
      "hurt at this catastrophe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It chafed his pride not a little to think that, after all his vaunts,\n",
      "the boy had maintained his ground, and got the better of him. For a man\n",
      "of forty-five to be worsted by a boy of fourteen was, it must be\n",
      "confessed, a little mortifying. It was something like a great ship of\n",
      "the line being compelled to surrender to a little monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one feels particularly dignified or good-natured when he is picking\n",
      "himself out of a mud puddle. Our black-haired acquaintance proved no\n",
      "exception to this remark. He shook his fist at the receding wagon and\n",
      "its occupant--a demonstration of defiance which our hero did not\n",
      "witness, his back being now turned to his late opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Abner Holden--for this was the stranger's name--next turned his\n",
      "attention to the buggy, which had been damaged to some extent, and so\n",
      "was likely to involve him in expense. This was another uncomfortable\n",
      "reflection. Meanwhile, as it was no longer in a fit state for travel, he\n",
      "must contrive some way to have it carried back to the stable, and,\n",
      "unless he could procure another vehicle, perform the rest of the journey\n",
      "on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, some men in a neighboring field had witnessed the collision,\n",
      "and, supposing their services might be required, were now present to\n",
      "lend their aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty bad accident,\" remarked one of them. \"That 'ere wheel'll need\n",
      "considerable tinkering afore it's fit for use. How came you to get it\n",
      "broke so, squire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little rascal had the impudence to dispute the road with me, and\n",
      "would not turn out at my bidding,\" said Mr. Holden, in a tone of\n",
      "exasperation, which showed that his temper had been considerably soured\n",
      "by the accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't turn out? Seems to me from the marks of the wheels, you must\n",
      "have been drivin' along in the middle of the road. I guess you didn't\n",
      "take the trouble to turn out, yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, there was room enough for the boy to turn out one side,\" said\n",
      "Holden, doggedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are slightly mistaken, stranger,\" said the other, who was disgusted\n",
      "at the traveler's unreasonableness. \"There wasn't room; as anyone can\n",
      "see that's got eyes in his head. Didn't the youngster turn out at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" snapped Holden, not relishing the other's free speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it seems you were the one that would not turn out. If you had been\n",
      "a leetle more accommodating, this accident couldn't have happened. Fair\n",
      "play's my motto. If a feller meets you halfway, it's all you have a\n",
      "right to expect. I reckon it'll cost you a matter of ten dollars to get\n",
      "that 'ere buggy fixed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Holden looked savagely at the broken wheel, but that didn't mend\n",
      "matters. He would have answered the countryman angrily, but, as he stood\n",
      "in need of assistance, this was not good policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you advise me to do about it?\" he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will have to leave the buggy where it is just now. Where did you\n",
      "get it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over at the mill village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you'd better lead the horse back--'tain't more'n a mile or so--\n",
      "get another wagon, and tell 'em to send for this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps that is the best way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where was you goin'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over to Waverley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's where the boy came from.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The boy that upset you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is his name?\" asked Abner Holden, scowling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His name is Herbert Mason, son of the Widder Mason that died two or\n",
      "three weeks since. Poor boy, he's left alone in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's he stopping?\" asked Holden, hardly knowing why he asked the\n",
      "question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Kent took him in after the funeral, so I heard; but the selectmen\n",
      "of Waverley are trying to find him a place somewheres, where he can earn\n",
      "his own livin'. He's a smart, capable boy, and I guess he can do 'most a\n",
      "man's work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden looked thoughtful. Some plan had suggested itself to him\n",
      "which appeared to yield him satisfaction, for he began to look decidedly\n",
      "more comfortable, and he muttered to himself: \"I'll be even with him\n",
      "YET. See if I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How far am I from Waverley?\" he asked, after a slight pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, risin' three miles,\" drawled the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I could get somebody to go back with this horse, I don't know but\n",
      "what I'd walk to Waverley. Are you very busy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know but I could leave off for a short time,\" said the\n",
      "other, cautiously. \"Work's pretty drivin', to be sure. What do you\n",
      "cal'late to pay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much would it be worth?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Without a word of thanks for the information, Abner Holden turned, and\n",
      "began to walk toward Waverley. Perhaps his object in making these\n",
      "inquiries has been guessed. It happened that he needed a boy, and, for\n",
      "more reasons than one, he thought he should like to have Herbert bound\n",
      "to him. Herbert, as he had noticed, was a stout boy, and he probably\n",
      "could get a good deal of work out of him. Then, again, it would be\n",
      "gratifying to him to have our hero in subjection to him. He could pay\n",
      "him off then, ten times over, for his insolence, as he chose to term it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll break his proud spirit,\" thought Abner Holden. \"He'll find he's\n",
      "got a master, if I get hold of him. He don't know me yet, but he will\n",
      "some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holden resolved to wait on Captain Ross at once, and conclude\n",
      "arrangements with him to take Herbert before our hero had returned from\n",

      "he learned who was to be his future master.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the help of a handkerchief dipped into a crystal stream at the\n",
      "roadside, Abner Holden succeeded in effacing some of the muddy stains\n",
      "upon his coat and pantaloons, and at length got himself into presentable\n",
      "trim for calling upon a \"selectman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he came in sight of the house which had been described to him\n",
      "as that of Captain Ross. There was a woman at the well-sweep engaged in\n",
      "drawing water.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, it's just behind the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I guess I'll go and find him. I want to see him on a little matter\n",
      "of business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holden crossed a mowing-field, and then, climbing over a stone wall,\n",
      "found himself at the edge of the three-acre lot. The captain was\n",
      "superintending one or two hired men, and, as he had his coat off, had\n",
      "probably been assisting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Ross?\" said Abner Holden, interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Do you live hereabouts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over at Cranston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'll come to the house, we'll talk the matter over. The boy's a\n",
      "good boy, and we want to get a good place for him. His mother was a\n",
      "widder, and he's her only son. He's a smart, capable lad, and good to\n",
      "work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no doubt he'll suit me. I'll take him on your recommendation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should want him to go to school winters. He's a pretty good scholar\n",
      "already. His father was a larned man, and used to teach him before he\n",
      "died. If he had lived, I reckon Herbert would certainly have gone to\n",
      "college.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll agree to send him to school in the winter for the next two years,\"\n",
      "said Holden, \"and will give him board and clothes, and when he's twenty-\n",
      "one a freedom suit, and a hundred dollars. Will that do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know but that's reasonable,\" said Captain Ross, slowly. \"The\n",
      "boy's a bit high-spirited, but if you manage him right, I guess you'll\n",
      "like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll manage him!\" thought Abner Holden. \"Can I take him with me to-\n",
      "morrow?\" he asked. \"I don't come this way very often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I guess that can be arranged. We'll go over to Dr. Kent's after\n",
      "dinner, and see if they can get him ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the meantime,\" said Holden, afraid that the prize might slip through\n",
      "his fingers, \"suppose we make out the papers. I suppose you have full\n",
      "authority in the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Ross had no objection, and thus poor Herbert was unconsciously\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After his collision with the traveler, Herbert hurried on to the mill,\n",
      "intent upon making up for lost time. He was satisfied with having\n",
      "successfully maintained his rights; and, as he had no reason to suppose\n",
      "he should ever again see his unreasonable opponent, dismissed him from\n",
      "his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the mill, he found he should have to remain an hour or two\n",
      "before he could have his grain ground. He was not sorry for this, as it\n",
      "would give him an opportunity to walk around the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" he thought, \"I could get a place in one of the stores here.\n",
      "There's more going on than there is in Waverley, and I could go over\n",
      "Sundays to see Dr. Kent's family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the spur of the moment, he resolved to inquire if some of the\n",
      "storekeepers did not require help. There was a large dry-goods store--\n",
      "the largest in the village--kept by Beckford & Keyes. He entered and\n",
      "inquired for the senior partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Beckford is not in,\" said the clerk. \"Mr. Keyes is standing at that\n",
      "desk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert went up to the desk, and said inquiringly, \"Mr. Keyes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is my name,\" said that gentleman, pleasantly. \"Is there anything I\n",
      "can do for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in search of a place,\" said our hero, \"and I thought you might\n",
      "have a vacancy here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have none just at present,\" said Mr. Keyes, who was favorably\n",
      "impressed by Herbert's appearance; \"but it is possible we may have in a\n",
      "few weeks. Where do you live? Not in the village, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" said Herbert, and a shadow passed over his face, \"My mother\n",
      "died three weeks since, and I am now stopping at the house of Dr. Kent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Kent--ah, yes, I know the doctor. He is an excellent man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is,\" said Herbert, warmly. \"He has been very kind to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert Mason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, Herbert, I will promise to bear you in mind. I will note down\n",
      "your name and address, and as soon as we have a vacancy I will write to\n",
      "you. Come into the store whenever you come this way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the store feeling quite encouraged. Even if the chance never\n",
      "amounted to anything, the kind words and manner of the storekeeper gave\n",
      "him courage to hope that he would meet with equal kindness from others.\n",
      "Kind words cost nothing, but they have a marvelous power in lightening\n",
      "the burdens of the sorrowful and cheering the desponding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert left the store, feeling that he should consider himself truly\n",
      "fortunate if he could obtain a place in such an establishment. But there\n",
      "was a rough experience before him, of which at present he guessed\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sauntering about the village a little longer, and buying a stick\n",
      "of candy for little Mary Kent, the doctor's only daughter, who was quite\n",
      "attached to Herbert, our hero got back to the mill in time to receive\n",
      "his bags of meal, with which he was soon on his way homeward.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the place where he met Mr. Holden he was hailed by a man at work\n",
      "in the field--the same who had taken back that gentleman's horse to the\n",
      "stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, boy, you had a kind of scrimmage, didn't you, coming over?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you see it?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the other, grinning. \"I seed the other feller in the mud\n",
      "puddle. He was considerably riled about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was his own fault. I gave him half the road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it; but there's some folks that want more than their share.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was his buggy broken? I don't know but I ought to have stopped to help\n",
      "him, but he had been so unreasonable that I didn't feel much like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His wheel got broken. I drawed the buggy into the bushes. There 'tis\n",
      "now. It'll cost him a matter of ten dollars to fix it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry for that,\" said Herbert; \"but I can't see that I was to blame\n",
      "in the matter. If I had turned out as he wanted me to, I should have\n",
      "tipped over, and, as the wagon didn't belong to me, I didn't think it\n",
      "right to risk it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not. You wasn't called on to give in to such\n",
      "unreasonableness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did the man go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He concluded to walk on to Waverley, and hired me to take the horse\n",
      "back to the stable. He wanted to know who you were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe he's goin' to sue you for damages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe he'll get much if he does,\" laughed our hero. \"My\n",
      "property is where he can't get hold of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ho! ho!\" laughed the other, understanding the joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this conversation Herbert continued on his way, and, after\n",
      "delivering the grain, took his way across the fields to his temporary\n",
      "home. He entered by the back yard. Little Mary came running out to meet\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have oo come back, Herbert?\" she said. \"Where have oo been?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Been to buy Mary some candy,\" he said, lifting her up and kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose horse is that at the gate?\" asked Herbert, as the doctor's wife\n",
      "entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It belongs to Captain Ross,\" she said. \"He has come on business\n",
      "connected with you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear boy, I am afraid we must make up our minds to lose you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has he found a place for me?\" asked Herbert, in a tone of\n",
      "disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I believe he has bound you out to a man in Cranston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be sorry to have you go, Herbert, but I thought you wanted to\n",
      "go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I do; but by waiting a few weeks I could probably get a place in\n",
      "Beckford & Keyes' store, at the mill village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert detailed his interview of the morning with the junior partner.\n",
      "Just at this moment the doctor entered the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you told him?\" he inquired, looking at his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and he says that but for this he might probably have got a chance\n",
      "to go into Beckford's store at the mill village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry for this. They are good men, and he would have been near us,\n",
      "while Cranston is forty miles away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is the man that wants me?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Mr. Holden. He is in the other room with Captain Ross. It was all\n",
      "arranged before they came. He wants you to go with him to-morrow\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So soon?\" said Herbert, in dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. At first he wished you to set off with him this afternoon; but I\n",
      "told him decidedly you could not be ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite impossible,\" said Mrs. Kent. \"Some of Herbert's clothes are in\n",
      "the wash, and I can't have them ready till evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better come into the other room, Herbert,\" said the doctor. \"I\n",
      "will introduce you to your new employer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert followed the doctor into the sitting-room. His first glance\n",
      "rested on Captain Ross, whom he knew. He went up and shook hands with\n",
      "him. Next he turned to Mr. Holden, and to his inexpressible\n",
      "astonishment, recognized his opponent of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Holden, Herbert,\" introduced the doctor. \"Mr. Holden, this is the\n",
      "boy we have been speaking of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have seen Mr. Holden before,\" said Herbert, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Holden, writhing his disagreeable features into an\n",
      "unpleasant smile. \"We have met before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kent looked from one to the other in surprise, as if seeking an\n",
      "explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our acquaintance doesn't date very far back,\" said Mr. Holden. \"We met\n",
      "this morning between here and the mill village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" said the doctor; \"you passed each other, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, no; I can't say we did exactly,\" said Mr. Holden, with the same\n",
      "unpleasant smile, \"We tried to, but the road being narrow, there was a\n",
      "collision, and I came off second-best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope there was no accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing to speak of. I got tipped out, and my clothes, as you may\n",
      "observe, suffered some. As for my young friend here, he rode on\n",
      "uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must excuse my not stopping to inquire if I could help you,\" said\n",
      "Herbert; \"but my horse was frightened by the collision, and I could not\n",
      "easily stop him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's of no consequence,\" said Mr. Holden, in an off-hand manner. He\n",
      "was determined not to show himself out in his true colors until he had\n",
      "got Herbert absolutely under his control.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where is your horse, Mr. Holden?\" asked Captain Ross. \"I think you\n",
      "were walking when you came to my house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sent it back to the village by a man I met on the road, my buggy\n",
      "being disabled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your carriage wasn't much injured, I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, not much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see exactly how it could happen,\" said Captain Ross. \"I thought\n",
      "the road from here to the mill village was broad enough at any point for\n",
      "carriages to pass each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't dream,\" said Mr. Holden, not noticing this remark, \"that the\n",
      "young man I had engaged was my young acquaintance of the morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert looked at him, puzzled by his entire change of manner--a change\n",
      "so sudden that he suspected its genuineness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more he thought of it, the more unwilling he felt to live with Mr.\n",
      "Holden. But could it be avoided? He resolved to try. He accordingly told\n",
      "the doctor and Captain Ross of the promise that Mr. Keyes had made him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be a good place,\" said the captain; \"but it ain't certain.\n",
      "Now, here's Mr. Holden, ready to take you at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I was in the mill village I could come over and see my friends here\n",
      "now and then. Besides, I think I should like being in a store.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I've got a store, too,\" said Mr. Holden, \"and I should expect you\n",
      "to tend there part of the time. I don't think I can let you off, my\n",
      "young friend,\" he added, with a disagreeable smile. \"I think we shall\n",
      "get along very well together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert did not feel at all sure of this, but he saw that it would do no\n",
      "good to remonstrate farther, and kept silence. Soon after, Mr. Holden\n",
      "and Captain Ross rose to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll call round for my young friend about nine to-morrow morning,\" said\n",
      "Abner Holden, with an ingratiating smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will endeavor to have him ready,\" said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "After they went away Herbert wandered about in not the best of spirits.\n",
      "He was convinced that he should not be happy with Mr. Holden, against\n",
      "whom he had conceived an aversion, founded partly upon the occurrences\n",
      "of the morning, and partly on the disagreeable impression made upon him\n",

      "Herbert woke up early the next morning, and a feeling of sadness came\n",
      "over him as he reflected that it was his last morning in Waverley. He\n",
      "was going out into the world, and, as he could not help thinking, under\n",
      "very unfavorable auspices. New scenes and new experiences usually have a\n",

      "golden butter, potatoes fried crisp and brown, and excellent coffee,\n",
      "might have tempted any appetite. Herbert, in spite of his sadness, did\n",
      "full justice to the bountiful meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family had hardly risen from breakfast when the sound of wheels was\n",
      "heard outside, and directly there was a knock at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Mr. Holden,\" said the doctor, looking from the front window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we part from you so soon, Herbert?\" said Mrs. Kent,\n",
      "affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where oo goin', Herbert?\" asked little Mary, clinging to his knee,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert's going away, Mary,\" said he, stooping and kissing his little\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert mustn't go 'way,\" said the little girl, in discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert come back soon, and bring candy for Mary,\" he said, wishing\n",
      "that his words might come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "By that time Mr. Holden had entered, and was surveying the scene with\n",
      "his disagreeable smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little Mary is quite attached to Herbert,\" said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" said Mr. Holden, \"that I have no little girls, as Herbert\n",
      "seems fond of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert doubted if he could become attached to anyone related to Mr.\n",
      "Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a bachelor,\" said Mr. Holden, \"though perhaps I ought to be ashamed\n",
      "to say so. If I had had the good fortune early in life to encounter a\n",
      "lady like your good wife here, it might have been different.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't too late yet, Mr. Holden,\" said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, perhaps not. If Mrs. Kent is ever a widow, I may try my luck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a disagreeable man,\" thought the doctor's wife, not propitiated by\n",
      "the compliment. \"Herbert,\" she said, \"here are a couple of handkerchiefs\n",
      "I bought in the village yesterday. I hope you will find them useful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; no doubt he will,\" said Mr. Holden, laughing. \"He will think of\n",
      "you whenever he has a bad cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody even smiled at this witty sally, and, Mr. Holden, a little\n",
      "disappointed, remarked: \"Well, time's getting on. I guess we must be\n",
      "going, as we have a long journey before us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole family accompanied Herbert to the road. After kissing Mary and\n",
      "Mrs. Kent, and shaking the doctor cordially by the hand, Herbert jumped\n",
      "into the wagon. Just before the horse started the doctor handed our hero\n",
      "a sealed envelope, saying, \"You can open it after a while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though, like most boys of his age, Herbert had a great horror of making\n",
      "a baby of himself, he could hardly help crying as he rode up the street,\n",
      "and felt that he had parted from his best friends. His eyes filled with\n",
      "tears, which he quietly wiped away with the corner of his handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, don't blubber, boy,\" said Mr. Holden, coarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was not weak enough to melt into tears at an unkind word. It\n",
      "roused his indignation, and he answered, shortly, \"When you see me\n",
      "blubbering, it'll be time enough to speak, Mr. Holden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looked a good deal like it, at any rate,\" said Abner. \"However, I'm\n",
      "glad if I'm mistaken. There's nothing to cry about that I can see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, perhaps not,\" said Herbert; \"but there's something to be sorry\n",
      "for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something to be sorry for, is there?\" said Abner Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've left my best friends, and I don't know when I shall see them\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" said Mr. Holden. \"But I think it's high time you left them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" asked Herbert, indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because they were petting you and making too much of you. You won't get\n",
      "such treatment as that from me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't expect it,\" said our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's lucky,\" said Abner Holden, dryly. \"It's well that people\n",
      "shouldn't expect what they are not likely to get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here a sense of the ludicrous came over Herbert as he thought of being\n",
      "Mr. Holden's pet, and he laughed heartily. Not understanding the reason\n",
      "of his sudden mirth, that gentleman demanded, in a tone of irritation,\n",
      "\"What are you making a fool of yourself about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What am I laughing at?\" said Herbert, not liking the form of the\n",
      "question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" snarled Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea of being your pet,\" explained Herbert, frankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holden did not appreciate the joke, and said roughly, \"You better\n",
      "shut up, if you know what's best for yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode along in silence for a few minutes. Then Abner Holden,\n",
      "thinking suddenly of the envelope which Dr. Kent had placed in Herbert's\n",
      "hand at parting, and feeling curious as to its contents, asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did the doctor give you just as you were starting?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an envelope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that; but what was there in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't looked,\" said our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a little satisfaction in snubbing Mr. Holden, whom he saw he\n",
      "would never like.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you open it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think of it before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose there is some present inside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert decided to open the envelope, out of respect for Dr. Kent. On\n",
      "opening it, he drew out a five-dollar bill, and a few penciled words,\n",
      "which were as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"DEAR HERBERT: I would gladly give you more if I had the means. I hope\n",
      "you will use the inclosed money in any way that may be most serviceable\n",
      "to you. You must write to me often. Be a good boy, as you always have\n",
      "been; let your aims be noble; try to do right at all hazards, and may\n",
      "God bless your efforts, and make you a good and true man. Such is the\n",
      "prayer of your affectionate friend, GEORGE KENT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert read these lines with emotion, and inwardly resolved that he\n",
      "would try to carry out the recommendations laid down. His thoughts were\n",
      "broken in upon by Mr. Holden, whose sharp eyes detected the bank-note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's money in the letter, isn't there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five dollars, hey?\" he said. \"You'd better give it to me to keep for\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Holden; I can take care of it, myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't a good plan for boys to have so large a sum of money in their\n",
      "possession,\" said Abner Holden, who was anxious to secure it himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because they are likely to spend it improperly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Kent didn't seem to think I was likely to do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he trusted you too much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope it won't prove so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better keep out of the way of temptation. You might lose it,\n",
      "besides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't often lose things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, boy,\" said Mr. Holden, getting impatient; \"Dr. Kent, no doubt,\n",
      "intended that I should take care of the money for you. You'd better give\n",
      "it up without further trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't he give it to you, then?\" demanded Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He supposed you would give it to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holden's motive for getting the money into his own hands was\n",
      "twofold. First, he knew that without money Herbert would be more\n",
      "helpless and more in his power. Secondly, as he had agreed to supply\n",
      "Herbert with clothing, he thought he might appropriate the money towards\n",
      "this purpose, and it would be so much of a saving to his own pocket.\n",
      "Perhaps Herbert suspected some such design. At any rate, he had no\n",
      "intention of gratifying Mr. Holden by giving up the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, are you going to give me the money?\" blustered Abner Holden,\n",
      "taking out his pocketbook, ready to receive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll repent this conduct, young man,\" said Holden, scowling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I shall,\" said our hero. \"I don't understand why you are\n",
      "so anxious to get hold of the money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is for your good,\" said Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather keep it,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden hardly knew what to do. The money was by this time safely\n",
      "stowed away in Herbert's pocket, where he could not very well get at it.\n",
      "However, he had a plan for getting it which he resolved to put into\n",
      "practice when they stopped for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "ON THE WAY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time they had ridden twenty miles both Herbert and Mr. Holden\n",
      "felt hungry. The fresh air had produced a similar effect upon both. They\n",
      "approached a broad, low building with a swinging sign and a long piazza\n",
      "in front, which it was easy to see was a country tavern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you feel hungry, boy?\" inquired Abner Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" returned our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I. I think I shall get some dinner here. You can get some, too,\n",
      "if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there's no occasion to thank me,\" said Mr. Holden, dryly. \"I shall\n",
      "pay for my dinner, and if you want any, you can pay for yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert looked surprised. As he had entered Mr. Holden's employ, he\n",
      "supposed of course that the latter would feel bound to provide for him,\n",
      "and it certainly seemed mean that he should be compelled to pay for his\n",
      "own dinner. However, he was beginning to suspect that his new employer\n",
      "was essentially a mean man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much will it cost?\" asked Herbert, at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thirty-seven cents,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be remembered that this was in the day of low prices, when gold\n",
      "was at par, and board could be obtained at first-class city hotels for\n",
      "two dollars and a half a day, and in country villages at that amount by\n",
      "the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thirty-seven cents!\" Herbert hardly liked to break in upon his scanty\n",
      "hoard, but the morning air had sharpened his appetite, and he felt that\n",
      "he must have something to eat. Besides, he remembered one thing which\n",
      "fortunately Mr. Holden did not know, that in addition to the five\n",
      "dollars which Dr. Kent had given him he had the ten dollars sent him by\n",
      "his uncle, and not only that, but a little loose change which he had\n",
      "earned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, are you going to get out?\" asked Abner Holden. \"It's nothing to\n",
      "me whether you take dinner or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I guess I will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Holden, who had a reason for being pleased with his\n",
      "decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both went into the tavern. There were two or three loungers on a settle,\n",
      "who gazed at them curiously. One of them at once appeared to recognize\n",
      "Abner Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dy do, Holden?\" he said. \"Who've you got with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A boy I've taken,\" said Holden, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A pretty smart-looking boy. Where'd you pick him up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over in Waverley. He's got some pretty high notions, but I guess I'll\n",
      "take 'em out of him in time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" chuckled the other; \"I warrant you will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While this conversation was going on Herbert had entered the tavern, but\n",
      "he could not avoid hearing what was said, including Mr. Holden's reply.\n",
      "He was not frightened, but inwardly determined that he would do his\n",
      "duty, and then if Mr. Holden saw fit to impose upon him, he would make\n",
      "what resistance he was able.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder what high notions he means,\" thought our hero. \"If he expects\n",
      "to make a slave of me, he will be mistaken, that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down there, and I'll go and order dinner,\" said Mr. Holden,\n",
      "entering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then, however, the landlord came in and greeted Abner Holden, whom\n",
      "he appeared to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want dinner for two, Mr. Robinson,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For two! You haven't brought your wife along with you, Holden?\" he\n",
      "said, jocosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I haven't come across any such lady yet. I've got a boy here who is\n",
      "bound to me. And hark you, landlord,\" he added, in a lower voice, that\n",
      "Herbert might not hear, \"he will pay you for his dinner out of a five-\n",
      "dollar bill which he has with him. YOU NEEDN'T GIVE BACK THE CHANGE TO\n",
      "HIM, BUT TO ME.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I understand,\" said the landlord, winking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I prefer to keep the money for him. He has refused to give it up and\n",
      "this will give me a chance to get hold of it without any fuss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he kept it himself he'd spend it in some improper way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so. I'll attend to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now our hero was gifted with pretty sharp ears, and he caught enough of\n",
      "this conversation to understand Mr. Holden's plot, which he straightway\n",
      "determined should not succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shan't take me in this time, Mr. Holden,\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his pocketbook to see if he had enough small change to pay for\n",
      "his dinner without intrenching upon his bill. There proved to be a\n",
      "quarter and two half-dimes, amounting, of course, to thirty-five cents.\n",
      "This would not be quite sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must change the bill somewhere,\" he said to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking out of the tavern window, he saw the village store nearly\n",
      "opposite. He took his cap and ran over. There was a clerk leaning with\n",
      "his elbows upon the counter, appearing unoccupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It occurred to Herbert that he might want some paper and envelopes. He\n",
      "inquired the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We sell the paper at a penny a sheet, and the envelopes will cost you\n",
      "eight cents a package.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you may give me twelve sheets of paper and a package of\n",
      "envelopes,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "The package was done up for him and in payment he tendered the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk gave him back four dollars and eighty cents in change. He put\n",
      "the money in his pocketbook, and the paper and envelopes in his jacket-\n",
      "pocket, and returned to the tavern well pleased with his success. Mr.\n",
      "Holden was in the barroom, taking a glass of \"bitters,\" and had not\n",
      "noticed the absence of our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner was soon ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some beefsteak and coffee and a whole apple pie. Herbert\n",
      "surveyed the viands with satisfaction, having a decidedly good appetite.\n",
      "He soon found, however, that hungry as he was, he stood a poor chance\n",
      "with Abner Holden; that gentleman, being a very rapid eater, managed to\n",
      "appropriate two-thirds of the beefsteak and three-quarters of the pie.\n",
      "However, the supply being abundant, Herbert succeeded in making a\n",
      "satisfactory repast, and did not grudge the amount which he knew he\n",
      "should have to pay for it before leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Abner Holden, his eyes twinkling at the thought of our\n",
      "hero's coming discomfiture, \"we'll go and settle our bill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Herbert, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the public room and advanced to the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This boy wants to pay for his dinner, Mr. Robinson,\" said Abner,\n",
      "significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much will it be?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thirty-seven cents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert took out of his vest pocket a quarter, a dime and two cents, and\n",
      "handed them over.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say that Abner Holden looked amazed is not sufficient. He looked\n",
      "disgusted and wronged, and glared at Herbert as if to inquire how he\n",
      "could have the face to outrage his feelings in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ho! ho!\" laughed the landlord, who, having no interest in the matter,\n",
      "was amused at the course affairs had taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert suppressed his desire to laugh, and looked as if he had no\n",
      "knowledge of Mr. Holden's plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did you get that money?\" growled Abner, with a scowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Out of my vest pocket,\" said Herbert, innocently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that, of course, but I thought you had only a bill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I got that changed at the store.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dared you go over there without my permission?\" roared Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think it necessary to ask your permission to go across the\n",
      "street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you know it now. Don't you go there again without my knowledge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you buy anything at the store?\" continued Mr. Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some paper and envelopes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humph!\" muttered Abner, discontentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He proceeded to pay his own bill and in a few minutes got into the wagon\n",
      "and drove off rather sulkily. Herbert saw that Mr. Holden was disturbed\n",
      "by the failure of his little plan, and felt amused rather than\n",
      "otherwise. But when he reflected that he was going to live with this\n",
      "man, and be, to a considerable extent under his control, he felt\n",
      "inclined to be sad. One thing he resolved that he would not submit to\n",
      "tyranny. The world was wide, and he felt able to earn his own living. He\n",
      "would give Mr. Holden a trial, and if he treated him with reasonable\n",
      "fairness he would remain with him. But he was not going to be any man's\n",
      "slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile they were getting over the road, and a few more hours brought\n",

      "little to one side, and the yard was littered up with a broken wagon, a\n",

      "The door was opened by an elderly woman, rather stout, who acted as\n",
      "Abner Holden's housekeeper. Though decidedly homely, she had a pleasant\n",
      "look, which impressed Herbert favorably. He had feared she might turn\n",
      "out another edition of Mr. Holden, and with two such persons he felt\n",
      "that it would be difficult to get along.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Considering that the hired horse had traveled over thirty miles, Herbert\n",
      "thought he was entitled to some oats; but Mr. Holden was a mean man, and\n",
      "decided otherwise.\n",

      "\"Up garret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a small corner bedroom in the second story,\" suggested Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford, who knew that the garret was not very desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess he won't be too proud to sleep in the garret,\" said Mr. Holden.\n",
      "\"Shall you?\" he continued, turning to Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put me where you please,\" said Herbert, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it shall be the garret. You can take your trunk up now. Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford will show you the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too heavy for you, Herbert,\" said the housekeeper; \"I will help\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he can carry it alone,\" said Abner Holden. \"He isn't a baby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather help him,\" said the housekeeper, taking one handle of the\n",
      "trunk. \"You go first, Herbert, You're young and spry, and can go faster\n",
      "than I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the second landing Herbert saw the little bedroom in which the\n",
      "housekeeper wanted to put him. It was plainly furnished, but it was\n",
      "light and cheerful, and he was sorry he was not to have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could have had that bedroom just as well as not,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford. \"It's never used. But Mr. Holden's rather contrary, and as\n",
      "hard to turn as a--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mule?\" suggested Herbert, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's pretty much so,\" said the housekeeper, joining in the laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went up a narrow staircase and emerged into a dark garret, running\n",
      "the whole length of the house without a partition. The beams and rafters\n",
      "were visible, for the sloping sides were not plastered. Herbert felt\n",
      "that he might as well have been in the barn, except that there was a\n",
      "small cot bedstead in the center of the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't very pleasant,\" said the housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Herbert, \"I don't think it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare, it's too bad you should have to sleep here. Mr. Holden isn't\n",
      "very considerate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess I can stand it,\" said our hero, \"though I should rather be\n",
      "downstairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll bring up the trap and set it before you go to bed,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The trap!\" repeated Herbert, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there's rats about, and I suppose you'd rather have a trap than a\n",
      "cat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; the cat would be about as bad as the rats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Abner Holden's voice was heard at the bottom of the\n",
      "stairs, and Mrs. Bickford hurried down, followed by our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were going to stay up there all day,\" said Mr. Holden.\n",
      "\"What were you about up there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is my business,\" said Mrs. Bickford, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper was independent in her feelings, and, knowing that she\n",
      "could readily obtain another situation, did not choose to be browbeaten\n",
      "by Mr. Holden. He was quite aware of her value, and the difficulty he\n",
      "would experience in supplying her place, and he put some constraint over\n",
      "himself in the effort not to be rude to her. With Herbert, however, it\n",
      "was different. HE was BOUND to him, and therefore in his power. Abner\n",
      "Holden exulted in this knowledge, and with the instinct of a petty\n",
      "tyrant determined to let Herbert realize his dependence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may go out and saw some wood,\" he said. \"You'll find the saw in the\n",
      "woodshed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What wood shall I saw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The wood in the woodpile, stupid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, sir,\" said our hero, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert thought Mr. Holden was losing no time in setting him to work.\n",
      "However, he had resolved to do his duty, unpleasant as it might be, as\n",
      "long as Abner Holden only exacted what was reasonable, and Herbert was\n",
      "aware that he had a right to require him to go to work at once. Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford, however, said a word in his favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got wood enough to last till to-morrow, Mr. Holden,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's likely the boy is tired.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's he done to make him tired, I should like to know? Ridden thirty\n",
      "miles, and eaten a good dinner!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which I paid for myself,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if you did?\" said Abner Holden, turning to him. \"I suppose you'll\n",
      "eat supper at my expense, and you'd better do something, first, to earn\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I am willing to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then go out to the woodpile without any more palavering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Holden,\" said the housekeeper, seriously, after Herbert had gone\n",
      "out, \"if you want to keep that boy, I think you had better be careful\n",
      "how you treat him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you say that?\" demanded Abner, eying her sharply. \"Has he been\n",
      "saying anything to you about me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why did you say that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I can see what kind of a boy he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what kind of a boy is he?\" asked Abner, with a sneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is high-spirited, and will work faithfully if he's treated well, but\n",
      "he won't allow himself to be imposed upon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can read it in his face. I have had some experience with boys, and\n",
      "you may depend upon it that I am not mistaken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He had better do his duty,\" blustered Abner, \"if he knows what's best\n",
      "for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will do his duty,\" said the housekeeper, firmly, \"but there is a\n",
      "duty which you owe to him, as well as he to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I always do my duty by boys, Mrs. Bickford?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Holden, I don't think you do. You know very well you can never\n",
      "get a boy to stay with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This boy is bound to me, Mrs. Bickford--legally bound.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That may be; but if you don't treat him as he ought to be treated, he\n",
      "will run away, take my word for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he does, he'll be brought back, take my word for that, Mrs.\n",
      "Bickford. I shall treat him as I think he deserves, but as to petting\n",
      "and pampering the young rascal I shall do nothing of the kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think you will,\" said the housekeeper. \"However, I've warned\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "sneeringly.\n",

      "\"Yes, I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After half an hour's acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've known him long enough to see that he's better than the common run\n",
      "of boys, and I hope that he'll stay.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "After working two hours at the woodpile, Herbert was called in to tea.\n",
      "There was no great variety, Abner Holden not being a bountiful provider.\n",
      "But the bread was sweet and good, and the gingerbread fresh. Herbert's\n",
      "two hours of labor had given him a hearty appetite, and he made a good\n",
      "meal. Mrs. Bickford looked on approvingly. She was glad to see that our\n",
      "hero enjoyed his supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was tea on the table, and, after pouring out a cup for Mr. Holden,\n",
      "the housekeeper was about to pour out one for Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He don't want any tea,\" said Abner, noticing the action. \"Keep the cup\n",
      "for yourself, Mrs. Bickford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean, Mr. Holden?\" asked the housekeeper, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tea isn't good for a growing boy. A glass of cold water will be best\n",
      "for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't agree with you, Mr. Holden,\" said the housekeeper, decidedly.\n",
      "\"Herbert has been hard at work, and needs his tea as much as you or I\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, without waiting for his permission, she handed the cup to\n",
      "Herbert, who proceeded to taste it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden frowned, but neither Herbert nor the housekeeper took much\n",
      "notice of it. The latter was somewhat surprised at this new freak on the\n",
      "part of Abner, as he had never tried to deprive any of Herbert's\n",
      "predecessors of tea or coffee. But the fact was, Mr. Holden disliked\n",
      "Herbert, and was disposed to act the petty tyrant over him. He had\n",
      "neither forgotten nor forgiven the boy's spirited defiance when they\n",
      "first met, nor his refusal to surrender into his hands the five dollars\n",
      "which the doctor had given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling tired by eight o'clock, Herbert went up to his garret room and\n",
      "undressed himself. An instinct of caution led him to take out the money\n",
      "in his porte-monnaie, and put it in his trunk, which he then locked, and\n",
      "put the key under the sheet, so that no one could get hold of it without\n",
      "awakening him. This precaution proved to be well taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert lay down upon the bed, but did not immediately go to sleep. He\n",
      "could not help thinking of his new home, and the new circumstances in\n",
      "which he was placed. He did not feel very well contented, and felt\n",
      "convinced from what he had already seen of Mr. Holden, that he should\n",
      "never like him. Then thoughts of his mother, and of her constant and\n",
      "tender love, and the kind face he would never more see on earth, swept\n",
      "over him, and almost unmanned him. To have had her still alive he would\n",
      "have been content to live on dry bread and water.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought, too, of the doctor's family and their kindness. How\n",
      "different it would have been if he might have continued to find a home\n",
      "with them! But when he was tempted to repine, the thought of his\n",
      "mother's Christian instructions came to him, and he was comforted by the\n",
      "reflection, that whatever happened to him was with the knowledge of his\n",
      "Father in heaven, who would not try him above his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try and trust! That was almost the last advice his mother had given him,\n",
      "as the surest way of winning the best success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he thought, \"I will try and trust, and leave the rest with God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Mr. Holden had not been able to keep out of his head the five\n",
      "dollars which he knew Herbert possessed. He was a mean man, and wished\n",
      "to appropriate it to his own use. Besides this, he was a stubborn man,\n",
      "and our hero's resistance only made him the more determined to triumph\n",
      "over his opposition by fair means or foul. It struck him that it would\n",
      "be a good idea to take advantage of our hero's slumber, and take the\n",
      "money quietly from his pocketbook while he was unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, about eleven o'clock, he went softly up the attic stairs\n",
      "with a candle in his hand, and, with noiseless steps, approached the\n",
      "bed. Herbert's regular breathing assured him that he was asleep. Abner\n",
      "Holden took up his pants and felt for his pocketbook. He found it, and\n",
      "drew it out with exultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" he thought; \"I've got it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But this brief exultation was succeeded by quick disappointment. The\n",
      "pocketbook proved to be quite empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curse it!\" muttered Abner, \"what has the boy done with his money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at this moment that Herbert, his eyes possibly affected by the\n",
      "light, awoke, and he discovered his employer examining his pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first feeling was indignation, but the sight of Abner Holden's\n",
      "disappointed face amused him, and he determined not to reveal his\n",
      "wakefulness, but to watch, him quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps he's got two pocketbooks,\" thought Abner. But in this he was\n",
      "mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next he went to Herbert's trunk, and tried it, but found it locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder where he keeps the key,\" was his next thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "He searched Herbert's pockets, but the search was in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Plague take the young rascal!\" he muttered, loud enough for Herbert to\n",
      "hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert turned in bed, and Abner Holden, fearing that he might wake up,\n",
      "and being on the whole, rather ashamed of his errand, and unwilling to\n",
      "be caught in it, went downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he didn't make much,\" thought our hero. \"It's lucky I thought to\n",
      "put the money in my trunk. If he only knew I had fifteen dollars,\n",
      "instead of five, he would be all the more anxious to get hold of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you sleep last night, Herbert?\" inquired the housekeeper at\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, thank you, Mrs. Bickford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was resolved not to drop a hint of what had happened, being curious\n",
      "to see if Mr. Holden would make any further attempts to obtain his\n",
      "money. As his employer might possibly find a key that would unlock the\n",
      "trunk, he thought it prudent, during the day, to carry the money about\n",
      "with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hardly knew whether to expect a visit from Abner the next night, but\n",
      "formed a little plan for frightening him if such a visit should take\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so happened that he had in his trunk a fish horn which had been given\n",
      "him by someone in Waverley. This he took out of the trunk before\n",
      "retiring and hid it under his pillow. It was about nine o'clock when he\n",
      "went to bed, but by considerable effort he succeeded in keeping awake\n",
      "for an hour or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "About eleven o'clock, Abner Holden, before going to bed himself, decided\n",
      "to make one more attempt to obtain possession of Herbert's money. He\n",

      "on the previous evening, and might have neglected to do so on the\n",
      "present occasion. He desired to get possession of it before any part of\n",
      "it was spent, as, judging from what he knew of boys, it would not remain\n",
      "long unexpended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, therefore, he took his candle, and removing his thick-soled\n",
      "shoes, which might betray him by their sound, crept softly up the steep\n",
      "and narrow staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Herbert heard him, and moreover was warned of his visit by the light\n",

      "\n",
      "Abner Holden looked towards the bed. Herbert's eyes were closed, and his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He's sound asleep,\" thought Abner, with satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set down the candle on a chair beside the bed, and began to examine\n",
      "our hero's pocketbook once more. But it proved to be empty as before. In\n",
      "the pocketbook, however, he found a key, the key, as he supposed, to\n",
      "Herbert's trunk. It was not, however, being only a key which Herbert had\n",
      "picked up one day in the street, and kept. He had put it in his pocket\n",
      "with a view to mislead his employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "That gentleman uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction when his\n",
      "fingers closed upon the key, never doubting for a moment that it would\n",
      "open the trunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the candle in its place, he rose from his recumbent position,\n",
      "threw the pants on the bed, and went round on the other side, to try the\n",
      "key.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got down on his knees before the trunk, and had inserted the key in\n",
      "the lock, or rather had made an ineffectual attempt to do so, when\n",
      "suddenly the candle was extinguished, and a horrible blast on the fish\n",
      "horn resounded through the garret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Abner Holden was not a very courageous man. In fact, he was\n",
      "inclined to superstition. He knew that he was engaged in a dishonorable\n",
      "attempt to rob a boy who was placed in his charge, and there is an old\n",
      "proverb that says \"conscience makes cowards of us all.\" It must be\n",
      "admitted that it was rather calculated to affect the nerves to find\n",
      "one's self suddenly in the dark, and at the same time to hear such a\n",
      "fearful noise proceeding from an unknown quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden jumped to his feet in dire dismay, and, without stopping to\n",
      "reflect on the probable cause of this startling interruption, \"struck a\n",
      "bee line\" for the staircase, and descended quicker, probably, than he\n",
      "had ever done before, narrowly escaping tumbling the entire distance, in\n",
      "his headlong haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert had to stuff the bedclothes into his mouth to keep from bursting\n",
      "into a shout of laughter, which would have revealed his agency in\n",
      "producing the mysterious noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I heard a frightful noise last night soon after I went to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Abner, \"I heard nothing. You were probably dreaming.\"\n",

      "\"Perhaps I was. Didn't you hear anything, Herbert?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sleep pretty sound,\" said Herbert, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden watched him as he said this, and was evidently more\n",

      "It would be hard to tell what Abner Holden's precise occupation was. He\n",
      "had thirty or forty acres of land, but only cultivated enough to produce\n",
      "supplies of vegetables for his own table, and grain for his horses. He\n",
      "kept four cows, and he had, at this time, three horses. He had the\n",
      "Yankee propensity for \"swapping,\" and from time to time traded horses,\n",
      "generally managing to get the best of the bargain, for he was tolerably\n",
      "sharp and not much troubled by conscientious scruples about misstating\n",
      "the merits of his horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, about two months before Herbert came into his employ, he had\n",
      "himself been overreached, and found himself the possessor of a horse of\n",
      "excellent outward appearance, but blind of one eye, and with a very\n",
      "vicious temper. He accepted the situation with a bad grace, and\n",
      "determined, as soon as possible, to \"trade\" the horse to another party.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, about a fortnight after Herbert's arrival, a gentlemanly-\n",
      "looking stranger knocked at Abner Holden's door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call was answered by the housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Holden at home?\" he inquired.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Holden.\" said the stranger \"I am in search of a good family horse.\n",
      "I am told that you have some animals for sale, and called on you,\n",
      "thinking I might get suited through you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've come to the right place,\" said Abner, glibly. \"I've got just the\n",
      "animal that will suit you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's in the pasture now. If you don't object to walking a short\n",
      "distance, I will show him to you. I feel sure he will suit you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, I will go with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This way, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two walked down a green lane at the back of the house to the\n",
      "entrance of the pasture, where the three horses, at present comprising\n",
      "Abner Holden's entire stock, were grazing leisurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it happened that, of the three, the blind and vicious horse was\n",
      "much the best looking. He held his head erect, had a graceful form, and\n",
      "was likely to attract favorable notice at first sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden paused at a little distance, and pointed him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think of that horse, Mr. Richmond?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very good-looking animal,\" said the stranger, with an approving\n",
      "glance; \"but I must explain that I want such an animal as my wife can\n",
      "drive. It is absolutely necessary that he should be good-tempered and\n",
      "gentle. If, with this, he is handsome, and of good speed, all the\n",
      "better. Now you know what I am in search of. Can you recommend this\n",
      "horse of yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Abner, confidently, \"he will just suit you. I did calculate\n",
      "to keep him for my own use, but I'm rather short of money, and I shall\n",
      "have to let him go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say he is gentle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, as gentle as need be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could a woman drive him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no trouble about that,\" said Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he has no serious defect?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that seems satisfactory. I like his appearance. He would look\n",
      "well in harness. What is your price?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two hundred and fifty dollars, cash down,\" said Abner. \"That's too\n",
      "cheap. He's worth a cool hundred more, but I got him cheap, and can\n",
      "afford to sell him cheap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse had cost Mr. Holden just a hundred and ten dollars, and at\n",
      "this price he considered himself decidedly taken in; but this he did not\n",
      "particularly care to mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two hundred and fifty dollars!\" mused the stranger. \"It is a little\n",
      "more than I intended to pay. Still, if the animal is what you describe,\n",
      "I don't know that I shall object on that score.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better take him,\" said Abner. \"It'll be the best bargain you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then shall we say it's a bargain?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite yet. I'll take till the afternoon to think about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better decide now. The fact is, Mr. Richmond, I ought not to let the\n",
      "horse go at that figure, and I may change my mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I shall take your horse, but I have agreed to look at another,\n",
      "and must see that first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It belongs to a man named Nichols.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam Nichols?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't advise you to have anything to do with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a regular sharper. You can't depend on anything he says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you for the caution. I will be on my guard. But I promised to\n",
      "take a look at his horse before deciding. If I don't come to terms with\n",
      "him, and I don't think I shall, I will come round some time this\n",
      "afternoon and make a bargain with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holden thought it was hardly politic to urge him farther. With a\n",
      "renewed caution as to dealing with Sam Nichols, he let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" thought Abner, after he was gone, \"it will be a pretty good\n",
      "thing if I get rid of Spitfire\"--he had named him thus--\"for two hundred\n",
      "and fifty dollars. He's a bad-tempered brute, and blind into the\n",
      "bargain. But I'm not bound to tell Mr. Richmond that, and so spoil my\n",
      "trade. I've put a flea in his ear about Nichols, and I guess he will be\n",
      "back again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of making a good bargain caused Abner to be unusually\n",
      "pleasant and good-humored, so much so that Mrs. Bickford regarded him\n",
      "with surprise. He voluntarily asked her if she did not wish something at\n",
      "the store, volunteering to bring home whatever was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's come over the man?\" thought the housekeeper. \"It's too good to\n",
      "last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was quite correct there. Mr. Holden was naturally crabbed, and fair\n",
      "weather with him was the exception rather than the rule. On the present\n",
      "occasion it did not last many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden went to the store, but made other calls on the way, so that\n",
      "he was three hours absent, and did not return till twelve o'clock, the\n",
      "usual dinner hour in his household.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Richmond, his caller of the morning, had been to see Sam\n",
      "Nichols, and inspected the horse he had for sale. He did not altogether\n",
      "like its appearance, and, moreover, he was prejudiced against him by\n",
      "what he had heard from Abner Holden, and came away without effecting a\n",
      "purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I can do better,\" he reflected, \"than to take that horse\n",
      "of Holden's. Let me see, it is only half-past ten. I shall have time to\n",
      "go up there this morning. I suppose I might as well settle matters at\n",
      "once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, eleven o'clock found him again in Abner Holden's yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was out in the yard, engaged in splitting wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Holden at home?\" inquired the stranger, pausing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will he be at home soon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, I think so. He only went out to the store. He ought to be\n",
      "home now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I think I will wait. I was here once before this morning. I was\n",
      "talking with him about buying one of his horses. If you can spare the\n",
      "time, I would like to have you go with me to the pasture, and I will\n",
      "take another look at the one I saw this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, sir,\" said Herbert, driving the ax into the block upon which\n",
      "he had been splitting, prepared to accompany Mr. Richmond to the\n",
      "pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the bars dividing the pasture from the next field. Spitfire\n",
      "was cropping the grass just on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the stranger, pointing him out, \"that is the horse I was\n",
      "looking at.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"THAT ONE!\" repeated Herbert, in a tone of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he is a fine-looking animal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye-es,\" said Herbert, hesitatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, I don't so much care about that, as for his being gentle. I\n",
      "want him for a family horse, such as my wife may drive, without fear,\n",
      "while I am away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did Mr. Holden say he's gentle?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. He recommended him highly for that, and told me he had no serious\n",
      "defect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure this is the horse?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly. I am not likely to be mistaken in it. I suppose it is all as\n",
      "he says?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was in a perplexing position. He knew that if he told the truth\n",
      "he should incur Abner Holden's anger, but his conscience revolted at\n",
      "suffering the stranger to be taken in, and thus, perhaps, exposing his\n",
      "wife to serious danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid I cannot confirm what Mr. Holden says,\" he answered,\n",
      "reluctantly. \"The horse is very ill-tempered, and is blind of one eye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it possible? Then I have had a narrow escape. You have done me a\n",
      "good service, my boy, in telling me the truth, for I am, myself, unused\n",
      "to horses, and should have taken the animal on your employer's\n",
      "recommendation. Accept this acknowledgment of my indebtedness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He would have placed a five-dollar bill in Herbert's hand, but our hero\n",
      "firmly refused to receive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only done my duty, sir. I cannot accept money for doing that.\n",
      "Thank you all the same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you are right, my lad. If I ever have a chance to serve you,\n",
      "don't hesitate to let me know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be a storm if Mr. Holden hears of this,\" thought Herbert. \"But\n",

      "from being overreached, though he know very well that Mr. Holden's rage\n",

      "independence that she enjoyed which led her to remain in the house.\n",
      "Knowing Abner's character, she was not particularly shocked at this last\n",

      "\n",
      "Herbert, perceiving the peril in which he stood, ran round the table,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Lord preserve us! The man is mad!\" ejaculated the housekeeper, trying\n",
      "to get out of the way. But in this she was not successful. The kitchen\n",
      "was small, and before she could guard against a collision, Abner had\n",
      "stumbled over Mrs. Bickford, and both came down together. She uttered a\n",
      "succession of piercing shrieks, and, with a view of relieving Herbert,\n",
      "pretended that her life was in danger, grasping Abner by the hair and\n",
      "holding him fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert saw that this was the favorable moment for escape, and, seizing\n",
      "his hat, dashed out of the house. He ran across the fields as fast as\n",

      "follow him, we will describe the scene that took place after his flight.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"I dare not,\" she said. \"I'm afraid you'll murder me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are making a fool of yourself,\" retorted Abner. \"What should I\n",
      "murder you for? But I will, if you don't let go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, who's talking of murder?\" demanded a rough voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was a neighbor, who chanced to be passing, and was led to\n",

      "\"Save me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bickford. \"He's threatened to murder me.\"\n",

      "equivocal position in which he was placed.\n",

      "\"What's all this row about? Mr. Holden, you ought to be ashamed of\n",
      "yourself for attacking a defenseless woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't intend to,\" said Abner, sullenly. \"She got in my way, and I\n",
      "stumbled over her; and then she seized me by the hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What were you going to do with that broom?\" demanded the other,\n",

      "\"What has he done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He? He's spoiled a trade of mine by his lying, and I was going to flog\n",
      "him for it, when Mrs. Bickford got in my way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, said the visitor, shrugging his shoulders, \"I don't want to\n",
      "interfere in your affairs. I suppose that you've a right to flog the\n",
      "boy. but it strikes me that a broom handle is rather an ugly weapon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't half heavy enough,\" said Abner, savagely; \"but where is the\n",
      "boy? Did you see him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Given leg-bail, I reckon, and I don't wonder at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run away?\" ejaculated Abner, disappointed. \"Did you see where he went?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I didn't, and if I had, I'm not sure that I would tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner would like to have thrashed the man who showed so little sympathy\n",
      "with his anger, but he felt that it would hardly be prudent. He went to\n",
      "the door and looked out. But there was no trace of Herbert to be\n",
      "discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll get it when he does come back,\" he said to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea that Herbert might not come back at all never once occurred to\n",

      "deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must now return to Herbert, whom we left running across the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "His departure had been so sudden, that his prominent idea was to get out\n",
      "of the way of his employer's violence. He was at first under the\n",
      "impression that he was pursued, but when, after running perhaps a\n",
      "quarter of a mile, he ventured to look around, he saw, to his great\n",
      "relief, that there was no one on his track. Being out of breath, he\n",
      "stopped, and, throwing himself down on the grass in the shadow of a\n",
      "stone wall, began to consider his plans for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was in doubt except one point. He felt that he had broken,\n",
      "finally, the tie that bound him to Mr. Holden. He would not return to\n",
      "him. He had experienced enough of Abner's ugly and unreasonable temper\n",
      "to feel that there could be no harmony between them, and as to\n",
      "submitting to personal violence from such a man as that, his blood\n",
      "boiled at the thought. He knew that he should resist with all the\n",
      "strength he possessed, and what the result might be he did not dare to\n",
      "think. What lay before him in the future he could not conjecture, but\n",
      "whatever it might be, he felt that it was better than to remain an\n",
      "inmate of Abner Holden's household, and in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where should he go? That was a question not easily answered. After\n",
      "his experience of his uncle's indifference to him, he did not wish to\n",
      "appeal to him for aid, yet he felt that he should like to go to New York\n",
      "and try his fortune there. Thousands of people lived there, and earned\n",
      "enough to support them comfortably. Why not he? It was a thousand miles\n",
      "off, and he might be some time in getting there. He might have to stop\n",
      "and work on the way. But, sooner or later, he resolved that he would\n",
      "find his way to the great metropolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was one difficulty which presented itself at the outset. This\n",
      "difficulty related to his clothing. He had on a pair of overalls and a\n",
      "ragged vest which Abner had provided for him, intending that he should\n",
      "save the good suit he brought with him for Sundays. His present suit,\n",
      "which had been worn by half a dozen of his predecessors, Herbert\n",
      "decidedly objected to wearing, as, in addition to being faded and worn,\n",
      "it was by no means a good fit. He must get his other suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was in Mr. Holden's attic, and it would hardly be prudent to\n",
      "venture back for it, as Abner was on the lookout for him, and there\n",
      "would be a collision, and perhaps he might be forcibly detained.\n",
      "Fortunately, his money he had about him. This amounted, as the reader\n",
      "already knows, to nearly fifteen dollars, and would, no doubt, be of\n",
      "essential service to him in the project which he had undertaken. As to\n",
      "the clothes, he must think of a way of securing them, before setting out\n",
      "on his journey to New York.\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as his breath was recovered, Herbert got up, and headed for\n",

      "way with some difficulty through the underbrush, parting the thick stems\n",
      "with his hands, until he reached a comparatively open space of perhaps\n",

      "it, sitting on the stump of a tree, which perhaps had been spared for\n",

      "rough hunting suit. His form, though spare, was tough and sinewy, and\n",
      "the muscles of his bare arms seemed like whipcords. A short, black pipe\n",
      "was in his mouth. The only covering of his head was the rough, grizzled\n",

      "and some cold meat. He took a tin measure, and, going out of the cabin,\n",

      "\n",
      "After dispatching the meal provided by his hospitable entertainer,\n",
      "Herbert sat down on the grass just outside the cabin, and watched lazily\n",

      "curl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long have you lived here, Ralph?\" asked our hero at length.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, boy, a long time in the life of one as young as you, but to me it\n",

      "here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you not often lonely?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lonely? Yes, but not more so than I should be in the haunts of men. I\n",
      "have company, too. There are the squirrels that leap from bough to bough\n",
      "of the tall trees. Then there are the birds that wake me with their\n",
      "singing. They are company for me. They are better company than men.\n",
      "They, at least, will not deceive me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and bent his eyes upon the ground. He was thinking, not of\n",
      "the boy beside him, but of some time in the past, and the recollection\n",
      "apparently was not pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon wore away at length, and the shadows deepened in the\n",
      "woods. Herbert wandered about, and succeeded in gathering some nuts,\n",
      "which he carried to Ralph's cabin. When eight o'clock came, the Ranger\n",
      "said: \"You had better lie down and rest, my boy; I will wake you up at\n",
      "twelve, and we will go together to Holden's place, and see if we can get\n",
      "your clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this proposal Herbert willingly assented, as he began to feel tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slept, he knew not how long, when he was gently shaken by Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where am I?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of the Ranger bending over him soon brought back the\n",
      "recollection of his position, and he sprang up promptly. Ralph showed\n",
      "him an easier way out of the woods than that by which he had entered,\n",
      "and less embarrassed by the growth of underbrush.\n",
      "\n",
      "In half an hour they were standing by Abner Holden's house. It was\n",
      "perfectly dark, the inmates probably being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know where the housekeeper sleeps,\" said Herbert. \"I'll throw up a\n",
      "pebble at her window, and perhaps it will wake her up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did as proposed. Mrs. Bickford, who was a light sleeper, heard, and\n",
      "went to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"What, Herbert? Shall I let you in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I don't want to come in. All I want is my clothes. They are up in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll go up and get them for you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"What are you going to do? Are you going to stop with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I am going East in a day or two. I am going to New York. I will\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to have you go, Herbert. I wish things could have been\n",
      "pleasanter, so that you might have stayed. But I think I hear Mr. Holden\n",
      "stirring. Good-by, and may God be with you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She closed the window hastily, and Herbert, not wishing to get into a\n",
      "collision with Abner Holden, who he suspected might have heard\n",
      "something, withdrew swiftly. Ralph, who was standing near by, joined\n",

      "A MOMENT OF PERIL\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden did not suspect that Herbert actually intended to leave him\n",
      "permanently; but when evening came, and he did not return, he became\n",
      "apprehensive that such was the case. Now, for more than one reason, he\n",
      "objected to our hero's leaving. First, because he was a strong, capable\n",
      "boy, and his services were worth considerable, and, secondly, because he\n",
      "disliked Herbert, and it was a satisfaction to tyrannize over him, as\n",
      "his position enabled him to do. There are some men in whom the instinct\n",
      "of petty tyranny exists to such an extent that they cannot feel happy\n",
      "without someone to exercise their authority over. Such a man was Abner\n",
      "Holden. He was a bully and a tyrant by nature, and decidedly objected to\n",
      "losing one so completely in his power as Herbert was.\n",
      "\n",
      "When night came and Herbert did not return, he decided to search for\n",
      "him, and bring him back, if found, the very next day. He did not impart\n",
      "his purpose to Mrs. Bickford, for he was at no loss to discover that the\n",
      "sympathies of the kind-hearted housekeeper were not with him, but with\n",
      "the boy whom he wished to abuse. When breakfast was over, therefore, he\n",
      "merely said: \"Mrs. Bickford, I am going out for a short time. If Herbert\n",
      "should return while I am absent, you may tell him to finish hoeing those\n",
      "potatoes in the garden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think he will come back, Mr. Holden?\" asked the housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he will soon be tired of wandering about. He will learn to prize a\n",
      "good home after he has slept out of doors one night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bickford did not reply; but she did not feel quite so much\n",
      "confidence as her employer appeared to do in the excellence of the home\n",
      "which Herbert had enjoyed under Abner Holden's roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as well he doesn't suspect Herbert's plan,\" she thought, and\n",
      "without further words, began to clear away the breakfast dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner was not long in deciding that Herbert was hidden in the woods.\n",
      "That, indeed, seemed the most natural place of refuge for one placed in\n",
      "his circumstances. He determined, therefore, to seek there first.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must now return to Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will wait till nightfall,\" said Ralph, \"you will be more safe\n",
      "from pursuit, and I will accompany you for a few miles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed plausible, and our hero consented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph went off on a hunting expedition, but Herbert remained behind,\n",
      "fearing that he might tear or stain his clothes, of which it was\n",
      "necessary, now, to be careful. How to pass the time was the question. To\n",
      "tell the truth, the hunter's cabin contained little that would help him.\n",
      "There were no books visible, for Ralph seemed to have discarded\n",
      "everything that would remind him of that civilization which he had\n",
      "forsaken in disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert went outside, and watched the squirrels that occasionally made\n",
      "their appearance flitting from branch to branch of the tall trees. After\n",
      "a while his attention was drawn to a bird, which flew with something in\n",
      "its beak nearly to the top of a tall tree not far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't wonder,\" thought Herbert, interested, \"if she's got a nest,\n",
      "and some young ones up there. I have a great mind to climb up and see\n",
      "whether she has or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He measured the tree with his eye. It was very tall, exceeding in its\n",
      "height most of its forest neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know as I can climb it,\" he said to himself, a little\n",
      "doubtfully; \"but anyway, I am going to try. There's nothing like\n",
      "trying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a lucky determination for Herbert, as will speedily appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was twenty feet to the first branching off, and this was, of course,\n",
      "the most difficult part of the ascent, since it was necessary to \"shin\n",
      "up,\" and the body of the tree was rather too large to clasp comfortably.\n",
      "However, it was not the first time that Herbert had climbed a tree, and\n",
      "he was not deficient in courage as well as skill. So he pushed on his\n",
      "way, and though once or twice in danger of falling, he at length\n",
      "succeeded in reaching the first bough. From this point the ascent was\n",
      "comparatively easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a short time our hero was elated to find himself probably fifty feet\n",
      "from the ground, so high it made him feel a little dizzy to look down.\n",
      "He reached the nest, and found the young birds--three in number. The\n",
      "parent bird hovered near by, evidently quite alarmed for the safety of\n",
      "her brood. But Herbert had no intention of harming them. He only climbed\n",
      "up to gratify his curiosity, and because he had nothing more important\n",
      "to do. Though he did not know it, his own danger was greater than that\n",
      "which threatened the birds. For, just at that moment, Mr. Holden, in his\n",
      "wanderings, had reached Ralph's cabin, and Herbert, looking down,\n",
      "beheld, with some anxiety, the figure of the unwelcome visitor. He saw\n",
      "Abner enter the cabin, and, after a few moments' interval, issue from it\n",
      "with an air of disappointment and dissatisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How lucky,\" thought our hero, \"that he did not find me inside!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden looked about him in every direction but the right one. He\n",
      "little dreamed that the object of his pursuit was looking down upon him,\n",
      "securely, from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think he'll find me,\" thought Herbert. \"Wouldn't he give\n",
      "something, though, to know where I am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But our young hero was doomed to disappointment. Just at that moment--\n",
      "the unluckiest that could have been selected--he was seized with a\n",
      "strong inclination to sneeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed lest the sound should betray him, he made desperate efforts to\n",
      "suppress it but Nature would have its way, and probably did so with\n",
      "greater violence than if no resistance had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ker-chew!\" sneezed Herbert, violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he anticipated, Abner's attention was attracted by the loud noise,\n",
      "which he rightly concluded could hardly proceed from a bird or squirrel.\n",
      "He had just been on the point of leaving the cabin for some other part\n",
      "of the woods, but at this sound he stood still. Looking up to discover\n",
      "whence it proceeded, his keen eyes detected Herbert in his lofty perch.\n",
      "His eyes sparkled with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, you young rascal!\" he exclaimed. \"So you are there, are you? You\n",
      "were going to run away, were you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that Herbert was actually discovered, his fear left him, and he\n",
      "became perfectly self-possessed and confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Holden,\" he answered, quietly; \"such is my intention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boldly spoken,\" said Abner, provoked by our hero's coolness, for he had\n",
      "hoped to find him terrified and pleading for forgiveness. \"I admire your\n",
      "frankness, and will try to equal it. I suppose you'll give it up as a\n",
      "bad job now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care, sir,\" said Abner, in anger and astonishment. \"Take care how\n",
      "you defy me. Come down here at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What for?\" inquired Herbert, without stirring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What for?\" repeated Abner Holden. \"That I may flog you within an inch\n",
      "of your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's no inducement,\" said our hero, coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you refuse to obey me?\" shouted Abner, stamping angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I refuse to be flogged. You don't get me down for any such purpose, Mr.\n",
      "Holden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, by Heaven, if you won't come otherwise, I'll come up and help you\n",
      "down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The angry man at once commenced the ascent. Anger gave him strength,\n",
      "and, though he was unaccustomed to climbing, he continued to mount up\n",
      "about halfway to the first branching off, somewhat to Herbert's\n",
      "uneasiness, for he felt there was a chance that he might fall into\n",
      "Abner's clutches.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Abner's success was only temporary. At the height of a dozen feet he\n",
      "began to slip, and, despite his frantic struggles, he slid gradually to\n",
      "the ground, tearing his coat, which he had not taken the precaution to\n",
      "remove, and blistering his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was to be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "In his anger and excitement, he drew a pistol from his breast pocket,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold!\" said Ralph, and, drawing his revolver from beneath his hunting-\n",
      "jacket, he pointed it at Abner. \"Two can play at that game, Abner\n",
      "Holden. This revolver is fully loaded. It gives me six chances of\n",
      "hitting you. You have but one chance with your pistol. The moment your\n",
      "finger touches the trigger, your doom is sealed. I never miss my aim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sickly hue overspread the face of Abner Holden. He had counted on\n",
      "Ralph's being unarmed. He saw that he had made an important and most\n",
      "unlucky mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put down your revolver,\" he said, in a very different tone. \"I wasn't\n",
      "in earnest, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know nothing of the kind,\" retorted Ralph. \"You looked to me as if\n",
      "you were very much in earnest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still with his revolver he covered Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put down your weapon,\" said Abner, nervously. \"It might go off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it might,\" returned Ralph. \"I will lower it, on one condition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you lay down your pistol on the ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner demurred, but finally felt compelled to do as he was commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is well,\" said Ralph, quietly. \"Now, I will take care that you are\n",
      "not tempted by it again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked toward the pistol, lifted it, and, pointing it in the reverse\n",
      "direction, fired it off among the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much for that,\" he said. \"Now, Herbert, you may come down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert complied promptly. He felt the utmost confidence in the prowess\n",
      "and good faith of his new friend, and did not fear to descend, though\n",
      "his bitterest enemy awaited him beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile an idea struck Abner Holden. He saw that he was no match for\n",
      "Herbert as long as Ralph chose to befriend him. He resolved to enlist\n",
      "the latter on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hark you, Ralph,\" he said, \"come aside with me. I wish to speak to you\n",
      "a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph followed him a few paces in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now what is it you have to say to me?\" he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About this boy,\" said Abner, insinuatingly. \"He is bound to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the law gives me authority over him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want him to go back with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you promise not to interfere between us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't promise that,\" said Ralph, briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay a moment,\" said Abner, seeing that he was on the point of leaving\n",
      "him; \"of course, I am willing to make it worth your while. I'll give\n",
      "you--well, three dollars, to help me secure him, and carry him back to\n",
      "my house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you take me for?\" asked Ralph, looking at the other, steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For a poor man,\" said Abner. \"Think a moment. Three dollars will buy\n",
      "you provisions for a week. They couldn't be more easily earned. In fact,\n",
      "you needn't do anything. Only promise not to interfere between the boy\n",
      "and myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph turned upon him scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have promised the boy my protection,\" he said, \"and you would have me\n",
      "forfeit my word for a paltry three dollars?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll give you five,\" said Abner, supposing that the sum he had offered\n",
      "was not sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not for five dollars, nor five thousand,\" returned Ralph, shortly. \"I\n",
      "thought you meant to insult me, but I see you only judge me by yourself.\n",
      "The boy shall not return with you. Make up your mind to that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can have you arrested,\" said Abner, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let that comfort you for the loss of the boy,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll have the boy, too,\" muttered Abner, turning to leave them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" demanded Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" demanded Abner, facing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I can't spare you yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What right have you to interfere with my movements?\" said Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None, perhaps; but I will inquire into that afterward. It is enough\n",
      "that, for the present, you must stay here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall do no such thing,\" said Abner, and he again turned to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph deliberately lifted his weapon, and took aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you say now?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely, you will not fire at me,\" said Abner, turning pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if you remain where you are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long do you mean to keep me?\" demanded Abner, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As long as may be necessary. That is all. Herbert, go into the cabin\n",
      "and look in one corner for a cord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert soon returned with a stout cord, tough and strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do with that?\" asked Abner suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to bind you,\" said Ralph, coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll have the law on you for this,\" said Abner, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All in good time,\" said Ralph. \"But I advise you to consider whether\n",
      "the law has nothing to say against attempted murder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean that you attempted to murder this boy, and would have done so,\n",
      "in all probability, if I had not interfered. When I am arrested, I shall\n",
      "feel it my duty to make this known to the authorities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner was silent. He felt that Ralph's testimony would have an ugly\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me go,\" he said, after a pause. \"You needn't be afraid of my\n",
      "troubling either of you. Don't tie me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Abner Holden,\" said Ralph, \"I know you, and I know you are not to be\n",
      "trusted. I have resolved to help this boy to escape from you, and I mean\n",
      "to do it effectually. For this purpose, I must subject you to temporary\n",
      "inconvenience. I advise you not to resist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had already tied the hands of Abner Holden, who, as he looked into\n",
      "the fearless, resolute face of the Ranger, felt that it would not do to\n",
      "resist. It chafed him most to think that Herbert, his bound boy, should\n",
      "be a witness of his humiliation, and he scowled savagely at our hero.\n",
      "But Herbert showed no triumph. His was a brave and generous nature, and\n",
      "had it rested with him, he would have let Mr. Holden go, but he did not\n",
      "think it best to interfere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph quickly tied both hands and feet, and then took the helpless body\n",
      "of Abner into the cabin, where he placed him in one corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you thirsty?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Abner, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph placed a cup of water to his lips. He also placed a loaf of bread\n",
      "beside him, which, though his hands were tied at the wrist, he would\n",
      "still be able to reach, and then beckoned to Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" he said, \"it is time that we were going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner gnashed his teeth with anger, as he watched them issue from the\n",

      "A FOUR-FOOTED FOE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden's reflections, when he found himself left alone in Ralph's\n",
      "cabin, bound hand and foot, were not of the most agreeable nature. It\n",
      "was humiliating to find himself baffled at every point, and, for once,\n",
      "completely defeated in his attempt to exercise his authority over the\n",
      "boy who had been bound to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Herbert should escape from him beyond the chance of recovery seemed\n",
      "now almost certain. If he were free, something might be done. But he was\n",
      "so securely bound that it was impossible to get free without help, and\n",
      "the lonely situation of the cabin made it very doubtful whether anyone\n",
      "would come within hearing until the return of Ralph himself. When that\n",
      "would be was uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three hours passed, and still no prospect of release. The bonds chafed\n",
      "his wrists, and his situation was far from comfortable. He tried to\n",
      "loosen the cords, but without success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must I stay here all night?\" he thought, in alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "But deliverance was at hand, though its first approach was disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large dog entered the cabin through the open door, drawn thither,\n",
      "probably, by curiosity. When he saw Abner he appeared to take a dislike\n",
      "to him, and barked vehemently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go away, you brute!\" said Abner, wrathfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog, however, appeared instinctively to understand that Abner Holden\n",
      "was able only to threaten him, and barked more furiously than before;\n",
      "sometimes approaching within a foot of the helpless prisoner, and\n",
      "showing a formidable row of teeth, which Abner feared every moment might\n",
      "fasten upon his arm or leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden was not a man of courage. Though his disposition was that\n",
      "of a bully, he was easily frightened, and the fierce look of the dog\n",
      "alarmed him not a little. In fact, it might have tested the courage of a\n",
      "much braver man than Mr. Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go away!\" he shrieked, shrinking back as far as he could from the open\n",
      "mouth of his persecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hoarse bark was the only reply, and the dog made an artful spring,\n",
      "which was only a feint, but had too much the appearance of earnest to\n",
      "suit his enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, will nobody save me from the brute?\" groaned Abner, in an ecstasy\n",
      "of terror. \"If I could only get my hands loose!\" and he tugged\n",
      "frantically at the cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling how utterly he was at a disadvantage, he condescended to coax\n",
      "his fierce antagonist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be quiet, that's a good dog,\" he said, with hypocritical softness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog noticed a change in his tone, and evidently viewed it with some\n",
      "suspicion. Still his bark became less fierce and his looks less\n",
      "threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good dog!\" repeated Abner, in wheedling tones. \"There's some dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he pushed over the provisions which Ralph had left.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the dog was apparently taking his offer into consideration, a\n",
      "boy's voice was heard outside, calling \"Carlo, Carlo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog pricked up his ears and ran out of the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you are here, you truant,\" said the boy. \"Why did you run away? What\n",
      "have you to say for yourself, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog answered by a wag of his tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you may wag your tail, but I've a great mind to punish you for\n",
      "running away, and putting me to the trouble of finding you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\" cried Abner, in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that?\" thought the boy, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the voice evidently came from within the cabin, he ventured to the\n",
      "door, and looked in. He was considerably surprised to see Abner Holden,\n",
      "whom he knew well by sight, lying bound hand and foot in the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that you, Mr. Holden?\" he asked, in a tone of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it is,\" said Abner, who was not in a very pleasant frame of\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you tied?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see I am?\" snarled Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who tied you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That rascal Ralph. I mean to have him hung, if I live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ralph! Why, I thought he was quiet and peaceable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He tried to murder me, but changed his mind, and tied me, as you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't understand it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no need of understanding it. Come and unfasten these cords. I\n",
      "feel stiff and cramped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy tried to unfasten the cord, but it was too securely tied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is your knife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got any.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then take the axe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an axe standing at the corner of the room. This the boy got,\n",
      "and, with the keen edge, severed the string.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner stretched himself to relieve his cramped limbs. Then he bethought\n",
      "himself of his late persecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that your dog?\" he asked, surveying his four-legged enemy with no\n",
      "friendly expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's Carlo. Come here, Carlo.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's been in here barking at me, and threatening to bite me, and now\n",
      "I'll have my revenge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" inquired the boy, in alarm, as Abner seized the axe\n",
      "and swung it over his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand aside, boy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to kill that brute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, he's a good dog. He won't do any harm,\" said the boy, in alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll kill him,\" said Abner, fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog surveyed his enemy with suspicion. He seemed to understand that\n",
      "danger menaced him. He growled in a low, hoarse, ominous tone, which\n",
      "showed that he was on his guard, and meant to do his part of the\n",
      "fighting, if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "His owner had retreated to the door, and now tried to call him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Carlo, Carlo, come out here, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Carlo would not come. He had no intention of shrinking from the\n",
      "danger that threatened him, but was bent on defending himself, as became\n",
      "a brave and dauntless dog, whose courage was above suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Abner had not been so exasperated, he might have been terrified, but\n",
      "anger re-enforced his courage, and, moreover, he had a great deal of\n",
      "confidence that the axe which he held in his hand would make him more\n",
      "than a match for the dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll kill him!\" he exclaimed, and once more he swung the axe over his\n",
      "head, and brought it down with a tremendous force in the direction of\n",
      "the dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas for poor Carlo, if the axe had struck him! But he was wary, and\n",
      "knew something of warlike tactics, and with watchful eye carefully noted\n",
      "Abner's movements. The boy uttered a cry of alarm at the peril of his\n",
      "favorite, but Carlo sprang to one side just as the axe descended, and it\n",
      "was buried in the earthen floor of the cabin so deeply that Abner could\n",
      "not immediately recover it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage was thus transferred to the other side, and the dog was\n",
      "not slow in perceiving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a bound he sprang upon his adversary, and bore him to the floor,\n",
      "seizing his coat between his strong teeth. He pulled and tugged at this\n",
      "with a strength which no ordinary cloth could possibly withstand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take him off! take him off!\" shrieked Abner in terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy sprang to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come away, Carlo,\" he said, grasping him by the collar; \"come away,\n",
      "that's a good dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But, habitually obedient as Carlo was, his young master found it\n",
      "difficult to get him away. He felt that he had received a grievous\n",
      "injury--that his life had been attempted--and he wanted to have\n",
      "satisfaction. Finally his master succeeded in drawing him away, but not\n",
      "till Mr. Holden's coat was badly torn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter was crestfallen and angry, and not so grateful as he ought to\n",
      "have been to his young defender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make your father pay for this coat, you young rascal!\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't my fault, Mr. Holden,\" said the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is. It was your dog that tore my coat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Carlo wouldn't have torn it, if you hadn't attacked him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He attacked me first.\"\n",

      "\"You had better go away, Mr. Holden, or he may go at you again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A low growl from the dog whom he held by the collar re-enforced this\n",
      "suggestion, and Abner, uttering threats both against the dog and his\n",
      "master, strode out of the cabin and bent his steps homeward.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he entered the kitchen, the housekeeper turned, and, noticing his\n",
      "torn coat, exclaimed, \"Good gracious, Mr. Holden, what's happened to\n",
      "you? How came your coat so badly torn?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have money,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About fifteen dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it not enough to carry me to New York?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hardly. Besides, when you get there, how will you get along? Have you\n",
      "any relations in the city?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, an uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you will go to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Herbert, hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He does not care to see me. Shall I tell you what sort of a letter he\n",
      "wrote to Dr. Kent about me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert, in indignant language, which correctly represented his\n",
      "feelings, gave the substance of the letter, which is already known to\n",
      "us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not feel easy,\" he said, \"until I am able to return the ten\n",

      "obligations to one who cares so little for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you are proud,\" said Ralph, bending his eyes upon the lad's\n",
      "glowing countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I am,\" said Herbert; \"but is it not a proper pride?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot say no,\" answered Ralph; \"but would you feel the same about\n",
      "incurring obligations to a friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Herbert; \"that would be different.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "from me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Herbert's surprise, Ralph drew out a small bag, originally intended\n",
      "for shot, and drew therefrom five golden coins, of five dollars each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take them,\" he said, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert hesitated, while his face indicated extreme surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought--\" he commenced, and then paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You thought me poor,\" said Ralph, finishing the sentence for him. \"Is\n",
      "it not so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most people think so,\" said Ralph. \"But it was not poverty that drove\n",
      "me from the busy world to this solitude. Rich or poor, I had money\n",
      "enough for my wants. Here I have little use for money. To me it is a\n",
      "useless and valueless thing. You need have no hesitation in taking this.\n",
      "But on second thoughts, I had better give you more.\" And he was about to\n",
      "draw forth more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Herbert, hastily. \"It is quite sufficient. You are very,\n",
      "very kind. Some time I hope to repay you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Ralph. \"Do not talk of repayment. Let me have the pleasure of\n",
      "giving you this small sum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How kind you are,\" said Herbert, impulsively, \"and to a stranger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet my obligation to you is greater than yours to me,\" said Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can that be?\" asked the boy, raising his eyes to Ralph's grave\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are the first human being in whose society I have taken pleasure\n",
      "for years. Deeply injured by man, I conceived a hatred for the whole\n",
      "race. But in your frank face I see much to like. I think I could trust\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have inspired in me a new feeling, for which I cannot account.\n",
      "Yesterday the world had no attractions for me. To-day I feel an interest\n",
      "in your welfare, at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you bury yourself in this lonely place?\" said Herbert. \"You\n",
      "cannot be happy in it. Come with me to New York. It must be a beautiful\n",
      "place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph smiled gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the young the world seems bright,\" he said. \"It is after years have\n",
      "swept away one illusion after another, after faith in one's fellowmen\n",
      "has been sorely tried, and the hollowness of the world's friendship has\n",
      "been proved, that the brightness fades.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have seen more of life than I,\" said Herbert, \"and perhaps it is\n",
      "presumption in me to question what you say; but I cannot help feeling\n",
      "that you are mistaken. I am sure that there is such a thing as true\n",
      "friendship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many true friends are you blessed with?\" asked Ralph, a little\n",
      "sarcasm in his tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not many, perhaps, but some. There is good Dr. Kent and his family. I\n",
      "am sure of their friendship. Then,\" he added, his color slightly rising,\n",
      "\"I think I have found another friend,\" and he looked in the face of his\n",
      "guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grave face softened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, my lad,\" said Ralph. \"You are right there, at least. You can\n",
      "rely upon my friendship being sincere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I am right, am I not?\" said Herbert, smiling brightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are,\" said the guide, after a pause, \"and I thank you for\n",
      "teaching me a lesson.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Man was made in the image of God,\" said Herbert. \"If we doubt man, I\n",
      "think it is the same as doubting God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph did not reply, but walked on in thoughtful silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How far is it to Vernon?\" asked Herbert, when they had emerged from the\n",
      "woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is five miles farther. Can you walk so far?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; I have good stout legs. But suppose Mr. Holden should escape.\n",
      "He might pursue us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I shall find him in the same place when I return,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will be very angry with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I suppose so,\" said Ralph, indifferently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you not afraid he will have you arrested?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I care little. If I am fined, I will pay the fine, and that will be\n",
      "the end of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you might be imprisoned?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I see any danger of that, I shall be tempted to charge Abner Holden\n",
      "with his attempt upon your life. Don't make yourself anxious about me,\n",
      "my lad. I have little fear of what the law may do as far as my agency in\n",
      "this affair is concerned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph seemed so entirely unconcerned that something of his confidence\n",
      "was imparted to Herbert. Noting the erect mien and fearless glance of\n",
      "his guide, every movement betokening strength, he could not help feeling\n",
      "that Abner Holden would be rash to make such a man his enemy. He felt\n",
      "safe in his protection, and his apprehensions of capture passed away. So\n",
      "with lightened heart he walked the five dusty miles to the village of\n",
      "Vernon, accompanied by Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a thrifty village, with neat and tasteful dwellings lining the\n",
      "principal street. The railroad and manufactories had built it up rapidly\n",
      "and given it an air of prosperity which was pleasant to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will go at once to the railway station,\" said Ralph. \"You may catch\n",
      "the next train, and it will be as well to leave this neighborhood as\n",
      "soon as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were fortunate enough to reach the station fifteen minutes before\n",
      "the eastern train departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert bought a ticket for Columbus, fifty miles distant, and entered\n",
      "the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-by, Herbert,\" said Ralph, from the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-by,\" said Herbert. \"Thank you for all your kindness to me. Shall I\n",
      "not see you again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know,\" said Ralph, musing. \"I have no wish nor intention of\n",
      "going to New York at present, yet I have a feeling that we shall meet\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope it may be so,\" said Herbert. \"I shall be glad to see you again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While he spoke the shrill sound of the railway whistle was heard, the\n",
      "train started, and Herbert was fairly off on his journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as he was leaving the depot, a wagon drove hastily up to the\n",
      "station, and Abner Holden jumped out. Herbert saw him as he looked from\n",
      "the window, and for a moment he was apprehensive, but the train was\n",
      "fairly on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop! stop!\" vociferated Abner. \"Stop, I say!\" for he had also caught\n",
      "sight of his bound boy on the way to freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't think they will stop the train for you, you fool!\" said a man\n",
      "standing by. \"You ought to have come sooner if you wanted to go by this\n",
      "train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to go by it,\" said Abner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy's run away, and I have just seen him aboard the train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's it, is it? Your son?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I hope not. It's a young rascal that's bound to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he's a young rascal, I shouldn't think you'd want him back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning away, for he saw that he had failed, his glance rested on Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly his anger rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's your doings,\" said he, shaking his fist in impotent wrath at the\n",
      "sturdy hunter, whom he would have attacked had he dared. \"It's your\n",
      "fault, and you shall pay for it if there's law in the land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will the law say to your attempt to shoot the boy?\" demanded\n",
      "Ralph, coolly.\n",

      "Herbert stopped overnight at Columbus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first train eastward left Columbus at seven o'clock in the morning.\n",
      "It was Herbert's intention to take this train, but unfortunately, as he\n",
      "thought at the time, the clock at the hotel by which his movements were\n",
      "guided was ten minutes too slow. The consequence was, that before he had\n",
      "quite reached the depot he saw the cars going out at the other end. He\n",
      "ran as fast as possible, hoping still to make up for lost time, but it\n",
      "was in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're too late, youngster,\" said a porter, who had been assisting to\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet, as he directly afterwards thought, it could make no particular\n",
      "difference, since he had no stated engagement to meet, and this\n",
      "consideration enabled him to bear the inevitable delay with a better\n",
      "grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose,\" he reflected, \"I might as well go back to the hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to leave the building when a carriage drove hastily up to the\n",
      "station. It was drawn by two horses, and driven by a negro in livery. A\n",
      "lady put her head out of the window and inquired anxiously if the train\n",
      "had started. She addressed this question to Herbert, who happened to be\n",
      "nearest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, madam,\" he answered, respectfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so sorry,\" said the lady, in a tone of vexation and perplexity.\n",
      "\"It was very important that my father should take that train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is another train that starts at twelve,\" said Herbert. \"It will\n",
      "make a difference of a few hours only.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the lady, \"but you do not understand my difficulty. The few\n",
      "hours' difference in time would be of small importance, but my father is\n",
      "blind, and is, of course, for that reason, dependent upon the kindness\n",
      "of others. A gentleman of our acquaintance was going by this train, who\n",
      "would have taken charge of him and seen him safe to his destination. By\n",
      "losing the train we lose his services.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said an elderly gentleman, sitting on the opposite seat, \"if\n",
      "I can get somebody to see me on board, I think I can manage very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On no account, father,\" was the hasty reply, \"particularly under\n",
      "present circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the gentleman going?\" asked Herbert, with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To Philadelphia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going on to New York,\" said our hero. \"I have been disappointed\n",
      "like you. I expected to take the early train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you intend to go by the next train, then?\" asked the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, madam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, perhaps--I have a great mind to ask you to take charge of my\n",
      "father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be very glad to be of service to you,\" said Herbert. \"There is\n",
      "only one objection,\" he added, with some embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Herbert, frankly, \"I am obliged to be economical, and I was\n",
      "thinking of buying a second-class ticket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the lady, promptly, \"there need be no difficulty about that.\n",
      "If you will take the trouble to look after my father, we will gladly pay\n",
      "for your ticket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid my services will not be worth so much,\" said Herbert,\n",
      "modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must leave us to estimate them. If you do what you have undertaken,\n",
      "we shall consider the expense well incurred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert made no further objection. He felt, indeed, that it would be\n",
      "quite a lift to him, in the present state of his finances, and besides\n",
      "would be a very easy way of earning the money. He therefore signified\n",
      "his thanks and his acceptance of the offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did you say the train starts?\" asked the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At twelve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nearly five hours. That will be too long to wait. I think, father, we\n",
      "will go home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear, I think that will be best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you obliged to go home before starting?\" the lady inquired,\n",
      "addressing Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, madam, I have no home in Columbus. I passed last night at a hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any particular plan for spending the next few hours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert answered in the negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then will you not ride home with us? You will then be ready to start\n",
      "with my father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be happy to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that will be much the best plan. Pompey, open the carriage door\n",
      "for the young gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hero was about to say that he could just as well open the door for\n",
      "himself, but he reflected that it was best to adapt himself to the\n",
      "customs of those he was with. He bowed, therefore, and waited till the\n",
      "coachman had opened the door for him, and stepped into the carriage. The\n",
      "lady signed to him to take a seat beside her, and the door was closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Home, Pompey,\" said she, briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coachman ascended to his seat, and the spirited grays were soon\n",
      "whirling the party rapidly homeward.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a new position for our hero, and he felt it to be so. His parents\n",
      "had never been rich, and latterly had been very poor. Living in a small\n",
      "country village, he had never even seen so elegant a carriage as that in\n",
      "which he was now riding He sank back upon the luxuriously cushioned\n",
      "seat, and he could not help thinking how pleasant it would be if he\n",
      "could command so comfortable a conveyance whenever he wanted to ride\n",
      "out. But another thought succeeded this. If he were blind, like the\n",
      "gentleman whom he was to take charge of, it would be a very poor\n",
      "compensation to ride in a luxurious carriage. After all, things were not\n",
      "so unequal as they seemed at first sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since you are to be my father's traveling companion,\" said the lady,\n",
      "\"perhaps you will not object to telling us your name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said our hero, \"my name is Herbert Mason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going from home for the first time?\" inquired the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no home,\" said Herbert. \"My father and mother are both dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said the lady, gently. \"I am sorry to have touched upon a\n",
      "subject which must awaken sorrowful recollections. My father's name is\n",
      "Carroll. Father, you have heard that your young escort is Mr. Herbert\n",
      "Mason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman extended his hand, which Herbert took respectfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid you will find me a troublesome charge,\" he said. \"Since I\n",
      "have become blind I have been compelled to tax the kindness of others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The journey will be pleasanter to me,\" said Herbert, politely, \"than if\n",
      "I were alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carroll was evidently pleased with this remark, for he turned toward\n",
      "Herbert with increased interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can imagine how much more so it will be to me,\" he said. \"I have\n",
      "not your resources for beguiling the tedium of the way. I would give all\n",
      "my possessions gladly, for your young eyes. All journeys are alike to me\n",
      "now, since, however interesting the scenery, it is a blank to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is indeed a privation, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Especially in the journey we are about to take. The Baltimore & Ohio\n",
      "Railroad, as it is called, runs through a romantic and charming country,\n",
      "and affords views at once bold and beautiful. Have you ever traveled\n",
      "over the road?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you will have all the pleasure of a first discovery. Before I\n",
      "became blind, before, indeed, the railway was located, I became, as a\n",
      "young man, familiar with this whole section of country, so that I have,\n",
      "at least, the remembrance of it. I am obliged now to live upon my\n",
      "memory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say you have never been over this railroad,\" said the lady. \"Have\n",
      "you ever been to the East?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, madam, I have always lived in the State of Ohio.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you are now going to Philadelphia?\" she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to New York,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! Is it on a visit?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, madam,\" said Herbert. \"I am not afraid but that I shall be able to\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a drive of three miles, which was accomplished in a short time by\n",
      "the spirited horses, the carriage entered, through an ornamental gate,\n",
      "upon a smooth driveway, which led up to a handsome mansion, of large\n",
      "size, with a veranda stretching along the entire front.\n",
      "\n",
      "A boy, a little smaller than Herbert, ran out of the front door, and\n",

      "the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, grandpa, come back?\" he said, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Oscar, we were too late for the train,\" said his mother. \"I\n",
      "brought you back a companion for a, few hours. This is Herbert Mason,\n",
      "whom I intrust to your care, depending upon you to see that he passes\n",
      "his time pleasantly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar looked at Herbert inquisitively.\n",
      "\n",

      "Oscar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long are you going to stay?\" asked Oscar, as his mother and\n",
      "grandfather went into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must return in time to take the twelve o'clock train.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'd find it more of a bore to be blind yourself,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I suppose I should. Grandpa wants me to go to walk with him\n",
      "sometimes, but I don't like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I had a grandfather who was blind, I think I should be willing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait till you have one, and you'll see how it is then.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What, alone? Yes, I should rather go that way. Then I could do as I\n",

      "time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That isn't what I mean exactly. I've got to earn my own living after I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You haven't run away from home, have you?\"\n",

      "\"They are both dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do?\"\n",

      "importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because your family is rich, I suppose,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we've got a large estate, ever so many acres. That's what mother's\n",
      "got. Then grandpa is rich besides, and I expect he will leave me a good\n",
      "deal of his money. He's pretty old, and I don't believe he'll live very\n",
      "long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar said this with such evident satisfaction that Herbert was\n",
      "disgusted, thinking it not very creditable to him to speculate so\n",
      "complacently upon his grandfather's speedy death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to be well off, then,\" said he, at last, to the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Oscar, \"our family is one of the first in the State. My\n",

      "expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got a plantation in Virginia. We live there part of the year. My\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Have you any brothers and sisters, Oscar?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got one sister. She's about twelve. But, I say, I thought you were\n",
      "a gentleman's son when I first saw you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am,\" said Herbert, emphatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was your father rich?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he have to work for a living?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he wasn't a gentleman,\" said Oscar, decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't anybody a gentleman that has to work for a living?\" asked\n",
      "Herbert, his indignation excited by his companion's assumption of\n",
      "superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Oscar, coolly. \"It isn't respectable to work.\n",
      "Niggers and servants work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is where I don't agree with you,\" said Herbert, his face flushing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't pretend to be a gentleman, do you?\" demanded Oscar,\n",
      "insolently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you're not one, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know anything of the kind,\" said Herbert, angrily. \"I suppose\n",
      "you call yourself one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, I am a gentleman,\" said Oscar, complacently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't talk like one, at any rate,\" retorted Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was new language for Oscar to hear. He had been accustomed to have\n",
      "his own way pretty much, and had been used to order round his father's\n",
      "servants and slaves like a little despot. The idea of being told by a\n",
      "boy who had to work for a living that he did not talk like a gentleman,\n",
      "did not suit him at all. His black eyes flashed and he clenched his\n",
      "fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to insult me?\" he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never insult anybody,\" said Herbert, not feeling particularly alarmed\n",
      "by this hostile demonstration. \"It is you that have insulted me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't you tell me I was not a gentleman?\" said Oscar, hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I said you did not talk like one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's about the same thing,\" said Oscar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you like. Even if I did say so, you said the same of me,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, suppose I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am as much a gentleman as you, to say the least,\" asserted Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you say that again, I'll knock you down,\" said Oscar, furiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll say it all day, if I like,\" said Herbert, defiantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it would have been better for Herbert to stop disputing, and to\n",
      "have taken no notice of Oscar's words. But Herbert was not perfect. He\n",
      "had plenty of spirit, and he was provoked by the airs Oscar chose to\n",
      "assume, and by no means inclined to allow him to arrogate a superiority\n",
      "over himself, merely on account of his wealth. Though manly and\n",
      "generous, he was quick to resent an insult, and accordingly, when Oscar\n",
      "dared to repeat what he had said, he instantly accepted the challenge as\n",
      "recorded above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Oscar been prudent, he would have hesitated before endeavoring to\n",
      "carry his threat into execution. A moment's glance at the two boys would\n",
      "have satisfied anyone that the chances, in a personal contest, were\n",
      "decidedly in our hero's favor. Herbert was not only a little taller than\n",
      "Oscar, perhaps an inch and a half, but his shoulders were broader and\n",
      "his frame more muscular. Oscar had never done any work to strengthen his\n",
      "arms, while Herbert had been forced by circumstances to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar flung himself upon Herbert, and endeavored to bear him to the\n",
      "ground. But the latter, without an effort, repelled the charge, and\n",
      "flung himself free from his antagonist's grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "This naturally made Oscar more determined to overcome his foe. His face\n",
      "red with passion, he showered blows upon Herbert, which the latter\n",
      "parried with ease. At first he acted wholly upon the defensive, but,\n",
      "finding that Oscar's impetuosity did not abate, suddenly closed with him\n",
      "and threw him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar rose but little hurt, for Herbert used no unnecessary force, and\n",
      "recommenced the assault. But the result was the same as before. Oscar\n",
      "was almost beside himself with mingled rage and mortification, and it is\n",
      "hard to tell how long the contest would have lasted, had not a servant\n",
      "come up and informed the boys that Mrs. Peyton wished to see them\n",
      "immediately. She had witnessed the whole scene from a window and felt\n",
      "called upon to interfere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is this, young gentleman?\" she asked, gravely. \"You have scarcely\n",
      "been together twenty minutes, and I find you fighting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Peyton,\" said Herbert, in a manly tone. \"I feel\n",
      "ashamed of myself, but Oscar attacked me for claiming to be a gentleman,\n",
      "and I am afraid that my blood was up, and so we got into a fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is this, Oscar?\" said his mother. \"Did you so wholly lose your\n",
      "politeness as to attack your guest for asserting his claims to be a\n",
      "gentleman? I am annoyed with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He says he has to work for a living,\" said Oscar, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So may you, some time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am rich.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may not always be. At any rate, being rich doesn't insure\n",
      "gentlemanly behavior, as your conduct to-day clearly shows. Herbert, I\n",
      "hope you will excuse my son's rudeness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is my hand, Oscar,\" said Herbert, cordially. \"Let us be friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar hardly knew how to receive this overture, but he was finally\n",
      "thawed by Herbert's manner, and they were soon sauntering about on the\n",
      "lawn on the best of terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past eleven, after an inviting lunch, the carriage was ordered,\n",
      "and Herbert and Mr. Carroll were driven to the depot, accompanied by\n",
      "Oscar, who went in his mother's place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert purchased tickets for both, being intrusted with Mr. Carrol's\n",
      "pocketbook for that purpose. He found a comfortable seat for the old\n",
      "gentleman, and sat down beside him.\n",

      "A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER\n",

      "\n",
      "I pass over the route pursued by the travelers from Columbus to\n",
      "Wheeling, in West Virginia, as it possesses no special interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after leaving Wheeling there is quite a change. Those of my readers\n",
      "who are familiar with the Baltimore & Ohio Railway will be able to\n",
      "understand the enjoyment which Herbert derived from the bold and\n",
      "romantic scenery visible from the car windows. Mr. Carroll made him take\n",
      "the seat nearest the window, that he might have a better view, and from\n",
      "time to time Herbert described what he saw to his sightless fellow-\n",
      "traveler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Northwestern Virginia is very mountainous and the construction of a\n",
      "railway through such a region was a triumph of engineering skill. At\n",
      "times the road makes bold curves, so that the traveler, looking from the\n",
      "car window, can see opposite him, across an intervening gulf, the track\n",
      "over which the train was passing five minutes before. At some places the\n",
      "track is laid on a narrow shelf, midway of the mountain, a steep and\n",
      "rugged ascent on one side, a deep ravine on the other, somewhat like the\n",
      "old diligence road over the Alpine Mt. Cenis. Here and there appear\n",
      "small hamlets, consisting of one-story cabins, with the chimney built\n",
      "alongside, instead of rising from the roof in the usual manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long shall we be in reaching Baltimore, Mr. Carroll? \"asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it takes about twenty-six hours,\" said the old gentleman.\n",
      "\"But I do not mean to go through without stopping.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know what your plan was,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been meaning to tell you. Our tickets will allow us to stop\n",
      "anywhere, and resume our journey the next morning, or even stop two or\n",
      "three days, if we like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is convenient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. If it had been otherwise, I should have purchased the ticket\n",
      "piecemeal. I cannot endure to travel all night. It fatigues me too\n",
      "much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where shall we stop, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not yet quite made up my mind. We will ride till about eight\n",
      "o'clock, and then stop over at whatever place we chance to have\n",
      "reached.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This arrangement struck Herbert favorably. He was in no particular\n",
      "hurry, and the scenery was so fine, that he feared that he should lose a\n",
      "great deal by traveling at night, when, of course, he could not see\n",
      "anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat for a while in silence. Then Mr. Carroll inquired, suddenly,\n",
      "\"Did you ever fire a pistol, Herbert?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" was the surprised reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you understand how to use one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, sir. There was a young man in Waverley, the town where I used\n",
      "to live, who owned one, and I sometimes borrowed it to fire at a mark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I think I will intrust this weapon to your charge,\" said the old\n",
      "gentleman, drawing from his pocket a handsome pistol, and placing it in\n",
      "Herbert's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it loaded, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not at present. We will have it loaded before going to bed. I will\n",
      "tell you,\" he added, in a lower tone, \"my reason for going armed. It so\n",
      "happens that I have a large amount of money with me, and, of course, I\n",
      "feel a little concerned about its safety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it will be well not to say anything more about it at present,\n",
      "sir,\" suggested Herbert, in a low voice. \"You may be heard by someone\n",
      "who would like to take advantage of his discovery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No doubt you are right. I will follow your advice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert would not have thought to give this caution, but, just as Mr.\n",
      "Carroll uttered the words, \"I have a large sum of money with me,\" a man\n",
      "dressed in a rough frieze coat, with black whiskers, and a general\n",
      "appearance, which, to say the least, did not prepossess Herbert in his\n",
      "favor, chanced to walk through the car. Whether he caught the words\n",
      "Herbert could not tell, but he paused a moment, and fixed an unpleasant\n",
      "eye upon the two, as if determined to know them when he should meet them\n",
      "again. There was another suspicious circumstance. It had evidently been\n",
      "his intention to pass through the car, but he paused abruptly, and,\n",
      "turning back, sank into an unoccupied seat a few feet back of that\n",
      "occupied by Mr. Carroll and his young companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attention naturally drawn by this suspicious conduct, Herbert was\n",
      "impelled to glance back once or twice. Each time he met the watchful\n",
      "look of the man fixed upon them, instead of being directed at the\n",
      "scenery outside, as was the case with the other passengers. When he saw\n",
      "that the boy was watching him, he turned his head carelessly, and\n",
      "commenced whistling. But this apparent indifference did not deceive\n",
      "Herbert for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will watch him,\" thought our hero. \"I do not like his looks. If he\n",
      "means mischief, as I think very probable, it is necessary that I should\n",
      "be on my guard against him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past seven o'clock Mr. Carroll signified his intention of\n",
      "getting out at the next station. \"I am beginning to feel tired,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and shall feel the better for a good supper and a night's rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, sir,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "It occurred to him that now they would get rid of the man who was\n",
      "watching them so closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he gets out of the train with us,\" he thought, \"I shall know what it\n",
      "means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The train slackened its speed, the sound of the whistle was heard, the\n",
      "brakes were applied, and soon the conductor, putting his head in at the\n",
      "door, called out \"Oakland!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here we are,\" said Herbert. \"Give me your hand, Mr. Carroll, and I will\n",
      "lead you out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman rose from his seat, and, guided by Herbert, walked to\n",

      "\n",
      "The man with the black whiskers, who a moment before seemed absorbed in\n",
      "a newspaper, had left his seat, and was but a few feet behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert did not believe that this was an accident. He felt sure that it\n",
      "meant mischief. But he did not on that account feel nervous, or regret\n",
      "that he had assumed a charge which seemed likely to expose him to peril.\n",
      "He had the pistol in his pocket, and that he knew would make him even\n",
      "with the rascal who was following them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a covered carriage waiting outside to convey passengers to the\n",
      "only hotel which the village afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we take the carriage, Mr. Carroll?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert assisted him in, and placed himself in a seat opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two or three other passengers, but the man with the black\n",
      "whiskers was not to be seen among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may be mistaken,\" thought Herbert, who had rather expected to see\n",
      "him. \"Perhaps he lives here, and I have been alarming myself without\n",
      "reason. Still, it is always best to be on one's guard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A ride of half a mile brought them to a small but comfortable-looking\n",
      "inn. Herbert assisted Mr. Carroll to descend, and together they entered\n",
      "the house of entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall want some supper. Herbert,\" said Mr. Carroll. \"You may order\n",
      "some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I order, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like some tea and toast and some beef-steak. If there is\n",
      "anything that you would prefer, you may order that also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, I should not wish anything better than you have ordered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell them to get it ready as soon as possible. I feel weary with my\n",
      "day's ride, and shall retire early.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel tired, too.\" thought Herbert, \"but it won't do for me to sleep.\n",
      "I must keep my eyes open, if possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was soon served. The toast was well browned, and spread with\n",
      "excellent butter. The steak was juicy and tender, contrary to the usual\n",
      "custom of country inns, and the tea was fragrant and strong. Both the\n",
      "travelers partook heartily, having eaten nothing since noon, with the\n",
      "exception of a little fruit purchased from the car window at one of the\n",
      "stations. Herbert was not usually in the habit of drinking tea at night,\n",
      "but on this particular occasion he wanted to keep awake, and therefore\n",
      "drank two cups, of undiminished strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Herbert,\" said Mr. Carroll, when they had finished supper, \"you\n",
      "may ask the clerk to assign me to a large room with a couple of beds in\n",
      "it. I should prefer to have you in the same room with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose from the table, and went to the public room, one portion of\n",
      "which was occupied by the office. As he made his way to the desk, he\n",
      "observed the man with black whiskers on a settee at one end of the room.\n",
      "He was smoking a clay pipe. Herbert caught a stealthy glance directed\n",
      "towards himself, but that was all. The man continued smoking, fixing his\n",
      "eyes with apparent interest on a large yellow handbill pasted on the\n",
      "opposite wall, announcing a performance by \"The Great American Circus\n",
      "Company\" the succeeding evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert succeeded in obtaining such a room as he sought, and accompanied\n",
      "by a servant bearing a lamp, went back to the dining-room to accompany\n",
      "Mr. Carroll to it.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XX\n",
      "\n",
      "FACING A BURGLAR\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert deliberated as to whether it would be best to inform his aged\n",
      "traveling companion of the suspicious-looking man, who appeared to have\n",
      "followed them for no good purpose. He finally decided not to do so,\n",
      "since it would only alarm Mr. Carroll, and prevent his sleeping off his\n",
      "fatigue, while there would be no advantage gained, since a blind and\n",
      "feeble man could be of little use in repelling the burglar, should the\n",
      "stranger prove to be such.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bedroom was large and square, and contained two beds. The larger of\n",
      "these was placed in the corner, and this was assigned to the old\n",
      "gentleman. The smaller was situated between the two side windows, and\n",
      "was, of course, the more exposed of the two. This Herbert was to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know how to load the pistol, Herbert?\" asked Mr. Carroll.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" said Herbert, confidently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't anticipate any occasion for using it,\" continued the old\n",
      "gentleman. \"Still, it will be best to be prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I think, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't be afraid to use it, if it should be necessary?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carroll took a package from his carpet-bag and showed it to Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This package,\" he said, \"contains five thousand dollars in bank bills.\n",
      "If it were known that I had it, I should be in danger. I suppose it will\n",
      "be best to put it back in the carpet-bag.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it were mine,\" said Herbert, \"I would not do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where, then, would you put it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would put it between the mattresses. If anyone should get into the\n",
      "room, they would seize the carpet-bag first, and, perhaps, make off\n",
      "before they could be stopped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know but you are right,\" said Mr. Carroll. \"Perhaps it will be\n",
      "well to put my watch in the same place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; I think it would be well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, Herbert,\" continued the old gentleman, \"how much confidence I\n",
      "repose in you. Knowing where my watch and money are, it would be very\n",
      "easy for you to secure both, and leave me here, destitute and helpless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you don't think there is any danger of my doing so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the old gentleman. \"Though our acquaintance is so recent, I\n",
      "feel great confidence in you. As I cannot see the face, I have learned\n",
      "to judge of the character by the tone of the voice, and I am very much\n",
      "mistaken if you are not thoroughly honest and trustworthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert, his face flushed with pleasure at this\n",
      "evidently sincere commendation. \"You shall not repent your confidence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure of that, Herbert,\" said Mr. Carroll, kindly. \"But I must bid\n",
      "you good-night. This has been a fatiguing day, and I shall lose no time\n",
      "in getting to sleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-night. I hope you will sleep well, sir,\" said Herbert. \"There\n",
      "won't be much sleep for me,\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carroll lay down, and his deep, tranquil breathing soon assured our\n",
      "hero that he was asleep. He rose from his bed and examined the windows.\n",
      "All but one were provided with fastenings. But the one on the right-hand\n",
      "side of his bed could be raised from the outside without difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had a nail,\" thought Herbert. \"I could soon make it fast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was none in the room, and he did not wish to go downstairs for\n",
      "one, since he would probably meet the stranger, who would then learn\n",
      "what precautions he was taking, and so, perhaps, vary his attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That window will need watching,\" thought Herbert. \"I wonder whether I\n",
      "shall be able to keep awake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The excitement of his situation, and, perhaps, the strong tea, to which\n",
      "he was unaccustomed, helped him to remain vigilant. His mind was active\n",
      "and on the alert, and his ears were open to catch the least sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only half-past ten. Probably the attempt to enter the room would\n",
      "not be made before twelve, at least, in order to insure their being\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert examined his pistol. It was in excellent order, and was provided\n",
      "with two barrels, both of which he loaded. Thus, he would have a double\n",
      "chance to defend himself. He did not remove all his clothing, but kept\n",
      "on his pants, in order to be prepared for emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an hour and a half to wait before midnight. The minutes passed\n",
      "slowly. Herbert for a time heard the murmur of voices in the barroom\n",
      "below, then steps ascended the stairs, and, after a while, all was\n",
      "hushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish the fellow would come quick,\" he thought, \"if he is coming at\n",
      "all, so that it might be all over, and I might go to sleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Time sped on. Herbert could hear the village clock striking twelve; but\n",
      "still all around remained quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might have been a half an hour later when he heard a slight noise, as\n",
      "he thought, under the window. Jumping softly out of bed, he took a peep\n",
      "out. It was just light enough for him to distinguish a dark form moving\n",
      "about, bearing something, which he soon perceived to be a ladder. That\n",
      "it was the black-whiskered man who had followed them, he did not doubt,\n",
      "and he felt confident that he intended to place the ladder against the\n",
      "window. He was not mistaken. He heard the top of the ladder softly\n",
      "inclined against the house, and then he felt that the critical moment,\n",
      "which was to test his courage, was close at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert's heart began to beat rapidly. He felt that he was taking upon\n",
      "himself a fearful responsibility in shooting this man, as he would\n",
      "probably be obliged to do in self-defense. But one thing he resolved\n",
      "upon. He would not take his life. He would only use such a degree of\n",
      "violence as should be absolutely necessary. He would even give him a\n",
      "chance by firing the first barrel in the air, in hope of frightening the\n",
      "robber. If that failed, he must wound him. There was little time for\n",
      "these thoughts to pass through his mind, for all the while the man was\n",
      "creeping up the ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert had moved a little aside, that he might not be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he perceived, by the indistinct light, the face of the stranger\n",
      "rising above the window-sill. Next, the window was slowly raised, and he\n",
      "began to make preparations to enter the room. Then Herbert felt that it\n",
      "was time for him to appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepping intrepidly to the window, he said: \"I know your purpose. Unless\n",
      "you go down instantly, I will shoot you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no tremor in his voice as he said this. Courage came with the\n",
      "occasion, and his tone was resolute, and self-possessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you're awake, are you, my chicken?\" was the reply. \"If you know\n",
      "what's best for yourself, you'll hand over the old man's money, and save\n",
      "me the trouble of getting in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I will take it myself, and give you something to remember me by,\n",
      "you little fool!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed his knee on the window-sill, and prepared to jump in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One step farther,\" said Herbert, resolutely, \"and I fire!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He displayed the pistol, at the sight of which the burglar hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on a bit,\" said he, pausing. \"I'll give you some of the plunder,\n",
      "if you'll put up that shooting iron, and make no trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think me a villain, like yourself?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By ----, you shall repent this,\" said the robber, with an oath, and he\n",
      "made another attempt to enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Click!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sharp report, but Herbert had fired in the air, and the\n",
      "burglar was unhurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Confusion!\" he exclaimed; \"that will raise the house!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, espying the carpet-bag, he determined to jump in, seize it, and\n",
      "get away before the people in the house were fairly awake. As for the\n",
      "pistol, that had been discharged, and he supposed that nothing was to be\n",
      "feared from it. But he reckoned without his host. As he put one leg\n",
      "over, and had all but succeeded in getting in, Herbert fired once more,\n",
      "this time hitting him in the shoulder. He uttered a shriek of pain, and,\n",
      "losing his hold, tumbled backward to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two reports alarmed the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" exclaimed Mr. Carroll, awakened and alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be alarmed, sir,\" said Herbert. \"A man just attempted to get in\n",
      "through the window, and I have wounded him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a brave boy,\" said Mr. Carroll. \"Where is he now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has tumbled to the ground, shot through the shoulder, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a loud thumping at the door. Herbert opened it, and admitted\n",
      "half a dozen guests, headed by the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" exclaimed all, in chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will come to the window, gentlemen, I will show you,\" said\n",
      "Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "They followed him curiously, and the sight of the ladder and the wounded\n",
      "man, who was uttering groans of pain from the ground below, told the\n",
      "story at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Served the rascal right,\" said the landlord. \"Who is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The black-whiskered man who was in the barroom last night,\" said\n",
      "Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember now; he asked particularly where you were to sleep--you and\n",
      "the old gentleman--but I did not suspect his purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did,\" said Herbert, \"and kept awake to be ready for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a brave lad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only did my duty,\" said Herbert, modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help! help!\" groaned the wretch below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert heard the cry of pain, and his heart was filled with pity. The\n",
      "man was, indeed, a villain. He had only been served right, as the\n",
      "landlord said. Still, he was a fellow-creature, and he was in pain.\n",
      "Herbert could not regret that he had shot him; but he did regret the\n",
      "necessity, and he felt sympathy for him in his suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor fellow!\" he said, compassionately; \"I am afraid he is a good deal\n",
      "hurt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor fellow!\" echoed the landlord. \"It serves him right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still, he is in pain, and he ought to be cared for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has no claim upon us. He may he there till morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mr. Carroll. \"Herbert is right. He is guilty, but he is in\n",
      "pain, and it is the part of humanity to succor him. Landlord, if you\n",
      "will have him brought in, and send for the doctor, you may look to me\n",
      "for your pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet, he was going to rob you, sir,\" said the landlord, considerably\n",
      "surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that is true; but you don't know how strongly he was tempted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He looks like a hard ticket. I didn't like to give him a bed, but we\n",
      "can't well refuse travelers, if they have money to pay their reckoning.\n",
      "I made him pay in advance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, lose no time,\" said Herbert, as another groan was heard; \"I will\n",
      "go out and help you bring him in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A lantern was lit, and the whole company followed the landlord out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, throwing the light of the candle full on the sufferer's\n",
      "face, \"you've got yourself into a fine pickle, haven't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" groaned the burglar, \"if it hadn't been for that accursed boy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd have got off with the old gentleman's money. Well, it was rather\n",
      "unkind to interfere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you in much pain?\" asked Herbert, bending over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something in his voice that betrayed the compassion he really\n",
      "felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burglar looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're the boy that wounded me, ain't you?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curse you! I don't know but you've killed me. I'm shot through the\n",
      "shoulder. Then, that cursed fall! I feel as if I had broken my back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not want to shoot you,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you do it for, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you forced me to it. You were after Mr. Carroll's money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I offer to divide with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but, of course, I would not agree to that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you so much better than common folks?\" sneered the burglar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know about that. I would not steal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take him up,\" said the landlord to the hotel servants. \"He don't\n",
      "deserve it, but I've promised the old gentleman we'd see to him. Tom\n",
      "White, you may go for the doctor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two men approached and attempted to lift the wounded burglar. But, in\n",
      "the first attempt, they touched the injured shoulder. He uttered a\n",
      "shriek of pain, and exclaimed, \"You'll murder me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me lift him,\" said Herbert. \"Perhaps you were too rough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, but not without much groaning on the part of the burglar, he\n",
      "was got into the house, and laid on a bed in a small room on the first\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you feel better?\" asked Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think you have broken any bones in falling?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so at first, but perhaps I am only bruised.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the doctor comes, he will extract the bullet, and relieve you of a\n",
      "good deal of your pain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a strange boy,\" said the burglar, with a look of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shot me, and yet you pretend to be sorry for me now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, why did you shoot me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already told you. Because I was obliged to. I would not have\n",
      "done it, if there had been any other way. I shot the first barrel in the\n",
      "air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By accident?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I thought it would alarm you, and I might save the money without\n",
      "injuring you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you really mean that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you don't have any ill-will against me now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is strange.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know why it should be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I ought to hate you, because you have brought me to this\n",
      "pass,\" said the burglar, thoughtfully, \"but I don't. That is strange,\n",
      "too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad you feel so,\" said Herbert. \"I am very sorry for your\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I haven't. I'm a rough customer, and have done plenty of mean\n",

      "wouldn't have done it, only I heard the old man say in the cars, that he\n",
      "had a lot of money with him. I was hard up, and on my way to Cedarville,\n",
      "to try to get work, but when I heard what he said, the devil tempted me,\n",
      "I believe, and I determined to keep you both in sight, and get out where\n",

      "\n",
      "The wounded man, who, under different treatment would have been defiant\n",
      "and profane, seemed quite subdued by such unexpected kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" he said. \"all I can say is, that I am very much obliged to\n",

      "Baltimore, and remained over night at a hotel. In the course of the\n",
      "succeeding day they arrived at Philadelphia, which was the termination\n",
      "of Mr. Carroll's journey. As the country through which they passed was\n",
      "unknown to Herbert, the journey was full of interest, but there was no\n",
      "adventure worth recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time came when the two travelers were compelled to part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I were going to a hotel, Herbert,\" said Mr. Carroll, \"I would invite\n",

      "house of a friend, and I shall not feel at liberty to invite you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert. \"I think it will be best for me to go on\n",

      "get to work as soon as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a praiseworthy feeling,\" said the old gentleman. \"Life lies\n",
      "before you. I have left nearly the whole of it behind me. I am drawing\n",
      "near the end of my journey. You are just at the beginning. I shall hope\n",

      "\"I am by no means sure of that. At any rate, the obligation remains. You\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Carroll drew out his pocketbook and handed it to Herbert.\n",

      "hope it may be of service to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You give me so much money?\" said Herbert, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is but a very small sum, compared with that which you have saved\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think I ought to take so much,\" said Herbert, hesitating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need not hesitate, my young friend. I am blessed with abundant\n",
      "means, and very well able to part with it. Besides, it is only one per\n",
      "cent. of the money which you have been instrumental in saving me, and\n",
      "you are certainly entitled to as much as that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you very much for the gift, Mr. Carroll,\" said our hero, \"and\n",
      "still more for the kind manner in which you give it to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You accept it, then? That is well,\" said the old gentleman, with\n",
      "satisfaction. \"There is one thing more. You remember that I spoke to you\n",
      "of a business firm in Pearl Street, New York, with the members of which\n",
      "I am acquainted. Last evening I prepared a letter of introduction to\n",
      "them for you. Here it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert. \"I was very fortunate in meeting with\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are very welcome to all the help I am able to give you. I shall be\n",
      "very glad if your life shall be as prosperous as mine has been. I must\n",

      "go at once to my friend's house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No difficulty was experienced in obtaining a carriage. There was a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "wouldn't pay me half what I was worth. I don't want to brag, but there\n",

      "you think I got?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only seven dollars a week. If I hadn't made something another way. I\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This was before the war had increased the expenses of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't do it. Board cost me four dollars a week, and that only left\n",
      "three for other expenses. My cigars cost me nearly that. Then I wanted\n",
      "to go to the theater now and then, and, of course, I must dress like a\n",
      "gentleman. I tell you what, seven dollars a week didn't begin to do me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you manage, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I made so much more by banking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By banking?\" repeated Herbert, in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; only it was a faro bank. I used to pick up considerable that way,\n",
      "sometimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A faro bank!\" repeated Herbert, in dismay. \"Why, that's the same as\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the odds? You take your chance, and you may win or lose.\n",
      "It's a pretty fair thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After this confession, Herbert became more than ever doubtful whether he\n",
      "should care to remain long in the company of his present companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the cars were moving rapidly. Peter Greenleaf, as he called\n",
      "himself, talked volubly, and appeared to have a considerable familiarity\n",
      "with certain phases of life, the knowledge of which was not likely to\n",
      "have been very profitable to him. Still, Herbert was interested in his\n",
      "communications, though the opinion which he formed of him was far from\n",
      "favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going to stop when you get to New York?\" inquired Peter.\n",

      "\"Suppose we go to French's Hotel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Near the park. It's on the European plan. You pay fifty cents a day for\n",
      "your rooms, and whatever you please for your meals.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I shall like that. I shall want to get into a boarding-house as\n",
      "soon as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. We'll take a room together at the hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This arrangement was not to Herbert's taste, but he did not care to\n",
      "offend his companion by objecting to it, so by his silence, he gave\n",
      "consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do in New York?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall look up a situation. I won't take less than fifteen dollars a\n",
      "week. A man of my experience ought to be worth that. Don't you think\n",
      "so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Herbert, dubiously, though it occurred to him that if he\n",
      "were an employer, he would not be likely to engage such a clerk at any\n",
      "price. But it is rather fortunate, all things considered, that we are\n",
      "able to keep our thoughts to ourselves, otherwise, the complacency of\n",
      "our companions, and sometimes our own, would run the risk of being\n",
      "rudely disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In course of time the terminus of the road was reached, and, crossing\n",
      "over from Jersey City, Herbert found himself, for the first time in his\n",
      "life, in the noise and whirl of the great city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am actually to live here,\" thought Herbert. \"I wonder what Mr.\n",
      "Holden would say if he knew where I was?\" Uncertain as his prospects\n",
      "were, he felt very glad that he was out of the clutches of the petty\n",
      "despot, whose chief pleasure was to make him uncomfortable. Here, at\n",
      "least, the future was full of possibilities of good fortune; there, it\n",
      "was certain discomfort and little to hope for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the hotel you spoke of?\" he asked, turning to Greenleaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll lead you to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up to Broadway, then up by the Astor House, and across the\n",
      "park to the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll go in and secure a room the first thing,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered, Greenleaf taking the lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Show us a room with two beds,\" said Peter to the clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "A servant was summoned, and the room assigned to them was indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any baggage?\" asked the clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Greenleaf, carelessly. \"Mine was checked through from\n",
      "Philadelphia. I shan't send for it till morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I must ask you to pay in advance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. Fifty cents, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mason,\" said Greenleaf, \"have you got a dollar about you? I've got\n",
      "nothing less than a ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert drew out a dollar and paid for himself and his companion.\n",

      "practical joke upon him, and he might now be downstairs, waiting to be\n",
      "amused at Herbert's look of dismay when he discovered that he was\n",
      "penniless. Drowning men will catch at straws, and Herbert, in his\n",

      "of mine, by name Herbert Mason. My acquaintance with him has been brief,\n",
      "but he has been able, by his coolness and bravery, to do me a most\n",
      "important service, having saved me from being robbed of a large sum of\n",
      "money while acting as my escort from Ohio to Philadelphia. I have talked\n",

      "honest living. I feel a strong interest in his success, and am persuaded\n",
      "that wherever he is placed, he will show rare capacity and fidelity. I\n",
      "wish it might be in your power to receive him into your own counting-\n",
      "room. But, of course, that must be according to your convenience. At any\n",
      "rate, may I rely on you to act a friendly part by my young friend, and\n",
      "to exert your influence toward procuring him a position elsewhere, if\n",
      "you cannot employ him yourself? Anything that you may have it in your\n",
      "power to do for Herbert, I shall consider as a favor done to myself.\n",

      "He decided to call and deliver it the same forenoon. If he had not been\n",
      "robbed of nearly the whole of his small capital, he would, first, have\n",
      "gone about the city, which was entirely new to him. But, with less than\n",
      "four dollars between himself and utter destitution, he felt that he had\n",
      "no time for sight-seeing. It was necessary that he should get to work as\n",
      "soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited till ten o'clock, thinking it possible that the heads of the\n",
      "firm might not reach the counting-room till about that time. It was now\n",
      "eight o'clock only. He had two hours, therefore, to look about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shine yer boots?\" said a ragged urchin, approaching, with a suggestive\n",
      "look at his soiled shoes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ten cents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too much,\" said Herbert, thinking how few dimes constituted his\n",
      "entire worldly wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, five, then,\" said the bootblack, coming down to his regular\n",
      "price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you get much to do?\" asked our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some days I get considerable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much do you make?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pleasant days I makes a dollar, but when it rains, there ain't much to\n",
      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much do you have to pay for sleeping?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six cents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six cents!\" repeated Herbert, in surprise. \"Where can you get lodged\n",
      "for that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the lodgin' house, corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" thought Herbert, \"I needn't starve. If I can't get anything\n",
      "better to do, I can buy a box of blacking and a brush, and set up in\n",
      "business for myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, this would not be an agreeable occupation, but Herbert was\n",
      "bound to make a living by honest labor. If one avenue was closed to him,\n",
      "he must enter such as were open to him. He could not afford to be\n",
      "particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his shoes were brushed, he crossed the park, and walked up\n",
      "Broadway. It was a wonderful sight to the country-bred boy, this gay\n",
      "thoroughfare, with its busy and bustling crowds, and its throngs of\n",
      "vehicles, never ceasing wholly, save at the dead hours of night. He\n",
      "thought to himself what a quantity of business there must be to do.\n",
      "Certainly, there must be room for one more worker. So, on the whole, the\n",
      "busy scene gave him courage, and he sauntered along as cheerfully as if\n",
      "he were not next-door to a beggar.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last the time came when he might safely seek out the gentleman to\n",
      "whom he had an introduction. Being a stranger in the city, he had to\n",
      "inquire for Pearl Street from a policeman, who answered his inquiry very\n",
      "civilly. He followed the direction, and found it at length. But the\n",
      "number of which he was in search was not so easily found, for he found\n",
      "the street meandered in a very perplexing way, so that at times he was\n",
      "not quite sure whether he was still in it, or had wandered from his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he found the place. It was a large, solid-looking building, of\n",
      "four stories in height. There were a number of boxes outside on the\n",
      "sidewalk. Inside, there was a large apartment occupying the entire first\n",
      "floor, with the exception of a room in the rear, which had been\n",
      "partitioned off for a counting-room. The partition was of glass, and, as\n",
      "he looked from the entrance, he could see a couple of high desks and a\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this Godfrey & Lynn's?\" he asked of a porter at the entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the porter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to see Mr. Godfrey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think he's in. You can go to the office and inquire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, Herbert passed down the length of the warehouse, and,\n",
      "pausing a moment before the door, he opened it, and entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two persons in the office. One was a thin-faced man, who sat\n",
      "on a high stool at one of the desks, making entries apparently in the\n",
      "ledger. This was the bookkeeper, Mr. Pratt, a man with a melancholy\n",
      "face, who looked as if he had lived to see the vanity of all things\n",
      "earthly. He had a high forehead naturally--made still higher by the loss\n",
      "of his front hair. Apparently, he was not a man to enjoy conviviality,\n",
      "or to shine on any festive occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides Mr. Pratt, there was a boy, if we may take the liberty of\n",
      "calling him such, of about Herbert's age. He was fashionably dressed,\n",
      "and his hair was arranged with exceeding care. In fact, as Herbert\n",
      "entered, he was examining the set of his necktie in a little hand-glass,\n",
      "which he had taken from his coat pocket. Not quite suiting him, he set\n",
      "himself to rearranging it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you copied that bill, Thomas?\" asked Mr. Pratt, looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have been long enough about it. Put back that glass. You are quite\n",
      "too much troubled about your appearance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I didn't look any better than some people,\" said Thomas, sotto voce,\n",
      "\"I shouldn't look in a glass very often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert naturally concluded that Mr. Pratt was the man to whom his\n",
      "inquiries should be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would like to see Mr. Godfrey, sir.\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is out of the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Out of the city!\" repeated Herbert, disappointed. \"When will he be\n",
      "back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor till day after to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert's countenance fell. In his reduced circumstances, he could\n",
      "hardly afford to wait two days. At his present rate of expenditure, he\n",
      "would be penniless by that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Lynn likely to be in soon?\" he asked, thinking that perhaps he\n",
      "would do in Mr. Godfrey's absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he is sick at home. He may not be here for a week. Perhaps, I can\n",
      "attend to your business,\" he added. \"What is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Herbert, \"that I will wait till day after to-morrow, if\n",
      "you think Mr. Godfrey will be back then. I have a letter for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's a business letter, you had better leave it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a letter of introduction,\" said Herbert. \"I would rather present\n",
      "it in person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" and Mr. Pratt went back to his ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas looked critically at the boy who had a letter of introduction to\n",

      "in spirits. The two days which must elapse before he could see Mr.\n",
      "Godfrey were to him a formidable delay. By that time his money would be\n",
      "almost exhausted. Then, suppose, which was very probable, Mr. Godfrey\n",
      "could do nothing for him immediately, but only hold out his promise of\n",
      "future assistance, how was he to live in the meantime? After all, he\n",
      "might have to realize his thought of the morning, and join the ranks of\n",
      "the bootblacks. That was not a pleasant thought to a boy of his\n",

      "\n",

      "such was the case with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked about rather aimlessly, feeling miserable enough. But, all at\n",
      "once, it occurred to him, \"Would it not be cheaper for him to take board\n",
      "by the week in some boarding-house?\" Reckoning up, he found that his\n",
      "hotel bill would be three dollars and a half a week, while his meals,\n",
      "even if he were quite abstemious, would make as much more; in all, seven\n",
      "dollars. Surely, he could be boarded somewhere for less than that.\n",

      "In the reading-room of the hotel he found a daily paper, and carefully\n",

      "rate of expense. I must go at once and secure it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He found the way to Stanton Street, and found that No. ---- was a\n",
      "shabby-looking house in a shabby neighborhood. But he could not afford\n",
      "to be fastidious. He accordingly stepped up without hesitation, and rang\n",

      "On the third floor, his guide threw open the door of a dark, little hall\n",

      "\n",
      "Examining his pocketbook he found that he had two dollars and a half\n",
      "left. Of that sum, two dollars must be reserved to pay the balance of\n",
      "his week's board. Out of the remaining fifty cents he must pay for his\n",
      "meals until the next morning, when he would take possession of his new\n",
      "boarding place. He wished that he had proposed to come to breakfast, but\n",
      "it was too late now.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a small sum in hand, he could not afford to dine on the same\n",
      "magnificent scale as he had breakfasted, but he must be rigidly\n",
      "economical. He decided that the cheapest food he could buy was a five-\n",
      "cent loaf at some baker's. This would probably last him through the day,\n",
      "and might prove sufficient for breakfast also, since he would take a\n",
      "regular dinner, though he doubted, from what he had seen of the\n",
      "establishment in Stanton Street, whether it would be a very inviting\n",
      "repast. But it was the best he could afford, and that was all he need\n",
      "consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in the afternoon, it occurred to Herbert to wonder where, in the\n",
      "city, his Uncle Stanton lived. Not that he had any intention of applying\n",
      "to him for assistance, even if matters came to a crisis, but he felt a\n",
      "natural curiosity as to how his uncle was situated. He found the\n",
      "directory readily, and, turning to the letter S, ran down the list of\n",
      "names till he came to Stanton, Benjamin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He learned that his uncle's store was in the lower part of Broadway,\n",
      "while his house was in West Seventeenth Street, between Fifth and Sixth\n",
      "Avenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to see what sort of a house Uncle Benjamin lives in,\"\n",
      "thought Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing to prevent his gratifying this wish, as he had plenty\n",
      "of time on his hands. If he had had more money, he would have taken the\n",
      "horse cars, but in his present circumstances this would be imprudent. He\n",
      "decided, as it was only five o'clock, to take a leisurely walk up\n",
      "Broadway, noticing his uncle's place of business on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes brought him in front of the latter--an imposing-looking\n",
      "building, with all the appearance of belonging to a prosperous merchant.\n",
      "Appearances are deceitful, to be sure, and no doubt there are some\n",
      "merchants, as outwardly prosperous, who might profitably change places\n",
      "with their head clerks. But Herbert naturally judged from appearances,\n",
      "and he could not help contrasting in his mind his own condition with\n",
      "that of his uncle's. But he was too manly to be despondent on this\n",
      "account, and thought rather, \"I am young and ready to work, Some time,\n",
      "if I am patient and work hard. I may be as well off as Uncle Benjamin.\"\n",
      "The thought of applying to him for assistance was as far off as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pursued his way uptown, finding it a longer walk than he anticipated,\n",
      "arriving at half-past five at Union Square. At the upper end he turned\n",
      "off, and went down Seventeenth Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carefully noting the numbers, he at length found his uncle's house. It\n",
      "was a handsome, substantial city mansion, and seemed appropriate as the\n",
      "residence of a rich New York merchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So my uncle lives here,\" thought Herbert, and there rose involuntarily\n",
      "in his mind the memory of the humble Western home where he and his\n",
      "mother had struggled against poverty, while his uncle, who was evidently\n",
      "so amply provided with the world's goods, coldly held aloof, and forbore\n",
      "to offer the assistance which he could so well afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I had a sister, I could never treat her like that,\" thought Herbert,\n",
      "indignantly. \"He would not help my mother. I will starve before I ask\n",
      "him to help me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused a moment on the opposite side of the street to look at his\n",
      "uncle's house. While he was standing there, a boy of about his own age,\n",
      "apparently, came down the street whistling, and ascended the steps of\n",
      "his uncle's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if that is my cousin Tom,\" thought Herbert. He knew the names\n",
      "of his cousins from his mother, though he had never seen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he looked, he was struck by something familiar in the appearance\n",
      "of this boy. Where had he seen him before?\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once it flashed upon him. It was the same boy he had seen in the\n",
      "counting-room of Godfrey He knew him by his dandified dress and his\n",
      "face, which he had noticed at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was certainly a strange coincidence, that his cousin, for it was\n",
      "doubtless he, should be the first boy he encountered after reaching New\n",
      "York. It would be still stranger if Mr. Godfrey should offer him\n",
      "employment, and he should find himself a clerk in the same office as the\n",
      "son of his rich uncle. But it was by no means certain that he would be\n",
      "lucky enough to obtain such employment. Therefore there was no need of\n",
      "wondering whether, under such circumstances, Tom would recognize him as\n",
      "a relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert walked thoughtfully back, and on reaching his room ate the\n",
      "remainder of the loaf which he had purchased at the baker's in the\n",
      "morning. It was not a very luxurious repast, but his walk had given him\n",
      "an appetite, and he had no difficulty in disposing of all that was left.\n",

      "The next morning Herbert reported himself at his new boarding place. He\n",
      "found the fare very far from first-class, while his fellow-boarders\n",
      "appeared at the table mostly in shirt-sleeves, and were evidently\n",
      "workingmen. Our hero would have preferred a greater degree of neatness\n",
      "both in the table and in the guests, but he felt that he would be lucky,\n",
      "if he should find himself able to pay his expenses even here. He was not\n",
      "to be daunted by little annoyances, but looked for compensation in the\n",
      "future.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited impatiently for the next day, when Mr. Godfrey would return.\n",
      "Upon the success of the interview with him much depended.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length it came, and Herbert once more set out for the warehouse on\n",
      "Pearl Street. He entered without question, and made his way to the\n",
      "counting-room. Looking through the glass door, he saw his cousin--whom\n",
      "he surveyed with new interest now that he knew the relationship--and the\n",
      "bookkeeper. But, besides these, there was an elderly gentleman, rather\n",
      "stout, with a pleasant face, the expression of which reassured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Godfrey in?\" he asked, on entering, with a look of inquiry at\n",
      "the gentleman just described.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is my name. What can I do for you?\" said Mr. Godfrey, turning\n",
      "towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a letter for you, sir,\" said Herbert, producing it from his\n",
      "pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Godfrey held out his hand for it, and ran his eye rapidly over its\n",
      "contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So your name is Herbert Mason?\" he said, raising his eyes after\n",
      "finishing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the mention of this name, Tom Stanton, whose curiosity had led him to\n",
      "listen to the conversation, wheeled rapidly round on his stool and\n",
      "surveyed our hero with intense curiosity. He knew that Herbert Mason was\n",
      "the name of his cousin. Could it be possible that this boy was the\n",
      "cousin whom he had never seen? A little later, and he was convinced of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have just come from Ohio, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend, Mr. Carroll, writes me that you were instrumental in saving\n",
      "him from being robbed while acting as his escort to Philadelphia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't worth mentioning,\" said Herbert modestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Godfrey noticed his modest tone, and it pleased him--modesty not\n",
      "being an unvarying characteristic of young America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend refers to it as an important service. I should like to know\n",
      "the particulars. Mr. Carroll is a connection of mine, and I am naturally\n",
      "interested in all that relates to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In reply Herbert gave a brief, but clear and intelligent account of the\n",
      "attempted burglary, passing over his own achievement as lightly as\n",
      "possible. But it was easy to infer, even from the little he said, that\n",
      "he had acted with bravery and self-possession,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You behaved in a very creditable manner,\" said Mr. Godfrey,\n",
      "approvingly. \"Many boys would have lost their self-possession. You have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't, of course, know how you were situated in Ohio,\" said the\n",
      "merchant, \"but as a general rule I think boys make a mistake in leaving\n",
      "the country for the city. Here the competition for work is sharp, and\n",
      "there is a surplus of laborers in every department of labor. Still,\" he\n",
      "proceeded, scanning Herbert's earnest face, \"you look like a boy capable\n",
      "of making his way if an opportunity offers. You have but little money,\n",
      "Mr. Carroll writes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have lost nearly all I had,\" said Herbert, \"so that now I have very\n",
      "little left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have met with a loss? Tell me about it. Indeed, I should be glad if\n",
      "you would confide to me freely your situation and hopes, and then I\n",
      "shall be better able to help you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "suppose I ought to have been more prudent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He recounted the manner in which Greenleaf had robbed him. Mr. Godfrey\n",
      "listened with interest, and so did Tom Stanton, who burst into a laugh\n",
      "when the narrative was concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you laughing at, Thomas?\" asked the merchant, rather sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking how neatly he was taken in,\" said Tom, a little abashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should apply a different word to it,\" said Mr. Godfrey. \"It appears\n",
      "to me the height, or rather the depth of meanness, to take advantage of\n",
      "a boy's confidence, and defraud him so scandalously. How much money have\n",
      "you left, Herbert?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forty cents, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only forty cents to begin life with in a great city!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Where do you board?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Stanton Street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom turned up his nose at the name of this street, which he knew was\n",
      "very far from fashionable, but this demonstration our hero did not\n",
      "observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What board do you pay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three dollars a week, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A poor place, probably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, but I could afford no better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are sensible to accommodate yourself to circumstances. Well, my\n",
      "young friend, it appears that you can't wait long for employment. Mr.\n",
      "Carroll has asked me to do something for you, and I am disposed to\n",
      "oblige him, not wholly for his sake, but partly for your own, for you\n",
      "seem to me a very modest and sensible boy. Mr. Pratt, do we need another\n",
      "boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, I don't think we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, business will be brisker by and by. I think you can find a little\n",
      "for this young man to do in the meantime. He can go to the post office,\n",
      "and I believe I have a little extra writing to be done. Pass him a pen,\n",
      "and let him give us a specimen of his handwriting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Herbert was a handsome writer, and this went a considerable\n",
      "way in his favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very neat,\" said the merchant. \"By the way, Herbert, I suppose, of\n",
      "course, you know nothing of French?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, I can read it pretty well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Godfrey, surprised. \"Then you can be of service to\n",
      "me, that is, if you know it well enough. I received, this morning, a\n",
      "letter from a silk house at Lyons, a part of which I don't quite\n",
      "understand. The fact is, my French is rather poor. Do you think you\n",
      "could help me translate it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will show me the letter, I will try, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant took a letter from the table before him and handed it to\n",
      "Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hero ran his eye rapidly over it, and then rendered it into English\n",
      "in a clear and grammatical way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me, you're quite a scholar,\" said Mr. Godfrey. \"I understand now.\n",
      "You've made it all plain. Where did you learn so much French?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father taught me, sir. He also taught me Latin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I congratulate you on possessing so good an education. Latin,\n",
      "however, isn't so much in my way. I haven't many Latin correspondents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose not, sir,\" said Herbert, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still, it does no harm to know something of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Stanton had listened with considerable surprise, mingled with\n",
      "mortification, to what had passed. It appeared then, that his country\n",
      "cousin, whom he had looked upon as a country boor, was his superior in\n",
      "education, and, as Tom secretly knew, in courage. And now he was going\n",
      "to be his fellow-clerk. He felt jealous and angry, fearing that Herbert,\n",
      "who appeared to be high in favor already, would eclipse him in the\n",
      "office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much can you live upon economically?\" asked the merchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know little of the city,\" said Herbert. \"You can judge better than I,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You pay three dollars a week board. You'll need double that amount. Mr.\n",
      "Pratt, you may pay him six dollars a week. He will come to work to-\n",
      "morrow morning, and you may pay him Saturday, as if it was a whole\n",
      "week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert, gratefully. \"You are very kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do your duty, my young friend, and I shall be satisfied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Stanton listened in indignant surprise. He only got four dollars a\n",
      "week, and here was a country boy placed over his head. He was imprudent\n",
      "enough to give expression to his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you give me six dollars a week, also?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I deserve as much as he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you do. But I don't give it to Herbert because he earns it, for\n",
      "it is not likely that he will do so at present. But he has no other\n",
      "resources. You have a comfortable home, and are not obliged to pay for\n",
      "your board out of your wages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I hope not,\" said Tom.\n",

      "motives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom did not reply, feeling that it would be imprudent to do so, but he\n",
      "bent sullenly to his work, by no mans satisfied with the explanation. He\n",
      "began to feel a dislike for his cousin, and determined to injure him, if\n",
      "he could, in the estimation of the firm. It would have been satisfactory\n",
      "if he could have looked down upon him as an inferior, but that was not\n",
      "easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope the fellow won't find out the relationship between us,\" he said\n",

      "\"If he were in actual distress, my dear,\" said Mr. Stanton, \"I should\n",
      "feel that I ought to do something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you'd allow yourself to be imposed upon, that's all I've got to\n",
      "say. There is no need of his being in distress. He is a stout boy, and\n",
      "capable of earning his own living.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He might get sick,\" suggested Mr. Stanton, who was not so hard-hearted\n",
      "as his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let him go to the hospital. It's provided for such cases.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Herbert good-looking?\" asked Maria, with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't get a prize for his beauty,\" said Tom, disparagingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he homely?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Tom, reluctantly. \"I suppose he'll pass; but he's\n",
      "countrified. He hasn't got any style,\" and he glanced complacently at\n",
      "his own reflection in a mirror, for Tom was vain of his personal\n",
      "appearance, though by no means as good-looking as Herbert. In fact, he\n",
      "was compelled secretly to confess this to himself, and for this reason\n",
      "was more than ever disposed to view his cousin with prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should like to see Herbert,\" said Maria, who had her share of female\n",
      "curiosity, and thought it would be pleasant to have a cousin to escort\n",
      "her round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I'd better invite him round to dinner tomorrow,\" said Thomas,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thomas will do no such thing!\" said Mrs. Stanton, decidedly. \"It's my\n",
      "opinion that the less notice we take of him the better. Your father is\n",
      "in good circumstances, to be sure, but whatever he is able to do, ought,\n",
      "of right, to go to his own family. We don't want any poor relations\n",
      "coming here to get their living out of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just my sentiments, mother,\" said Tom Stanton, approvingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't seem quite right,\" said Mr. Stanton, uncomfortably, \"to\n",
      "neglect my sister's child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't make yourself ridiculous with your scruples, Mr. Stanton,\" said\n",
      "his wife. \"It's the boy's duty to take care of himself. It would only do\n",
      "him harm, and lead to false expectations, if we allowed him the run of\n",
      "the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Besides,\" said Tom, \"I shouldn't want to have Tom Paget and Percy\n",
      "Mortimer, and other fellows that I associate with, ask me who he is, and\n",
      "have to tell them that he is my cousin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument had considerable weight with Mr. Stanton, who was anxious\n",
      "to elevate himself in society, and looked with complacency upon the\n",
      "school acquaintances Tom had formed with the scions of distinguished\n",
      "families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, rising from the table, \"let it be as you will. We won't\n",
      "go out of our way to invite the boy here, but if he presents himself, as\n",
      "he doubtless will, we must take a little notice of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see why he couldn't have stayed in the country,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Stanton. \"It was the best place for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, it was,\" said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He could have had no other object than to seek us out, and see what he\n",
      "could get out of us. For my part, I would advise you to recommend him to\n",
      "go back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has secured a place, it seems, and would not be likely to give it\n",
      "up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a great pity he should have got into the same counting-room with\n",
      "Tom. He will presume on the relationship as soon as he finds it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stanton need not have been alarmed, for Herbert was too high-\n",
      "spirited to seek an intimacy where he had reason to think it would be\n",
      "disagreeable. But his aunt knew nothing of him, and judged him by\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's there, and it can't be helped,\" said Mr. Stanton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At any rate, if he does stay in the city,\" persisted Mrs. Stanton, \"I\n",
      "hope you'll give him to understand that he needn't call here more than\n",
      "once in three months. That is as much as he can expect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all, he is my sister's son,\" said Mr. Stanton. \"I can't feel that\n",
      "this would be quite kind in us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave it to me, then. If you're too soft-hearted, Mr. Stanton, I will\n",
      "take all the responsibility, and the blame, if there is any.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I think you've said enough on the subject,\" said her husband.\n",
      "\"Tom, run upstairs and bring me a cigar. You know where I keep the cigar\n",
      "box.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better send a servant, father,\" said Tom, coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appears to me you are getting lazy, Thomas,\" said his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thomas is right,\" said Mrs. Stanton. \"What do we keep servants for but\n",
      "to run errands?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still, Tom might have obliged me in such a little matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shouldn't have asked him, Mr. Stanton. You seem to forget that we\n",
      "are not living in the style of half a dozen years ago. You should adapt\n",
      "yourself to circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton said no more, but sent a servant in Tom's place. But he\n",
      "could not help thinking that the outward prosperity for which he was\n",
      "striving was not without its drawbacks, since it compelled him to look\n",
      "to servants for the most ordinary services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Tom went to the counting-room, fully expecting that\n",
      "Herbert would claim relationship as soon as he discovered his name.\n",
      "While he would be compelled to admit it, he determined to treat Herbert\n",
      "with such a degree of coolness that he would take the hint, and keep his\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived at the counting-room, Herbert was already there, and Mr.\n",
      "Pratt also.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-morning,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Morning,\" muttered Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is Thomas Stanton, your fellow-clerk,\" said Mr. Pratt, the\n",
      "bookkeeper. \"I believe you have not been introduced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now for it,\" thought Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "But rather to his surprise, Herbert made no demonstration, but merely\n",
      "bowed slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does it mean?\" thought Tom, a little perplexed. \"Is it possible\n",
      "that he is not my cousin, after all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you came from Ohio?\" inquired Tom, impelled by his curiosity to\n",
      "ask the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you stay there? Couldn't you make a living there?\" asked\n",
      "Tom, not over-politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably I might,\" said Herbert, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I think you should have stayed there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which do you like best, the city or the country?\" asked our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there's a difference. I have always lived in the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose boys often do come from the country to the city,\" said\n",
      "Herbert. \"Was your father born in the city?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Tom, glancing keenly at Herbert, to see if he meant anything\n",
      "by the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it seems he must have preferred the city to the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had his share of curiosity. He knew that it would be better not to\n",
      "pursue this subject further if he wished his cousin to remain ignorant\n",
      "of the relationship between them. Still, he was anxious to know what\n",
      "Herbert's actual knowledge was, and whether he would be likely to avail\n",
      "himself of it. He was therefore tempted to say, \"I suppose you have no\n",
      "relations in the city?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think I haven't?\" asked Herbert, looking at Tom rather\n",
      "peculiarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think anything about it. I only asked,\" said Tom, a. little\n",
      "confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have an uncle in the city,\" said Herbert, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed,\" said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said nothing more, for he felt that he might betray his knowledge of\n",
      "the relationship unintentionally. Herbert's manner left him as much in\n",
      "the dark as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pratt set Herbert to work on some writing, and Tom, also, was soon\n",
      "busy. After a while Mr. Godfrey came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-morning, Herbert,\" he said, pleasantly, offering his hand. \"So Mr.\n",
      "Pratt has set you to work, has he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we shall find enough for him to do, eh, Mr. Pratt?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, I think so,\" said the bookkeeper, who perceived that Herbert\n",
      "was in favor, and it was as well to fall in with his employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's well. How do you like your boarding place, Herbert?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't a very nice one, sir, but it is as good a one as I have a\n",
      "right to expect for the money I pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come round and dine with us to-night,\" said the merchant. \"Mrs. Godfrey\n",
      "will be glad to see you. I'll give you my street and number.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert. \"I shall be glad to accept your kind\n",
      "invitation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom listened to this invitation with envy. Mr. Godfrey occupied a high\n",
      "social position. Moreover, he had a pretty daughter, whom he, Tom, had\n",
      "met at dancing school, and he would have been very glad to receive the\n",
      "invitation which had been extended to \"that beggar, Herbert,\" as he\n",
      "mentally styled him.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXVII\n",
      "\n",
      "AT THE CONCERT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert felt a little diffident about accepting his employer's\n",
      "invitation to dinner. Brought up in the country in comparative poverty,\n",
      "he felt afraid that he should show, in some way, his want of\n",
      "acquaintance with the etiquette of the dining table. But he had a better\n",
      "than ordinary education, and, having read diligently whatever books he\n",
      "could get hold of, possessed a fund of general information which enabled\n",
      "him to converse intelligently. Then his modest self-possession was of\n",
      "value to him, and enabled him to acquit himself very creditably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia Godfrey, the merchant's only daughter, was a lively and animated\n",
      "girl, a year or two younger than Herbert. She had been the belle of the\n",
      "dancing school, and Tom Stanton, among other boys, had always been proud\n",
      "to have her for a partner. She, however, had taken no particular fancy\n",
      "to Tom, whose evident satisfaction with himself naturally provoked\n",
      "criticisms on the part of others. Of this, however, Tom was unconscious,\n",
      "and flattered himself that his personal appearance was strikingly\n",
      "attractive, and was quite convinced that his elaborate and gorgeous\n",
      "neckties must attract admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia awaited the advent of her father's young guest with interest, and\n",
      "her verdict was favorable. He was, to be sure, very plainly dressed, but\n",
      "his frank and open face and pleasant expression did not need fine\n",
      "clothes to set them off. Julia at once commenced an animated\n",
      "conversation with our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Weren't you frightened when you saw the robber?\" she asked, for her\n",
      "father had told her of Herbert's adventure with the burglar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Herbert, \"I did not feel afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How brave you must be?\" said Julia, with evident admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was no need of my being frightened,\" said Herbert, modestly. \"I\n",
      "was expecting him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I should have been frightened to death,\" said Julia, decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a girl, you know,\" said Herbert. \"I suppose it is natural for\n",
      "girls to be timid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know but it is, but I am sure it is not natural to all boys to\n",
      "be brave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was out in the country, one day, walking with Frank Percy,\" proceeded\n",
      "Julia, \"when a big, ugly-looking dog met us. Frank, instead of standing\n",
      "by, and defending me, ran away as fast as his feet could carry him. I\n",
      "laughed at him so much about it that he doesn't like to come near me\n",
      "since that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you escape?\" asked Herbert, with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw there was no use in running away, so I patted him on the head,\n",
      "and called him 'Poor dog,' though I expected every minute he was going\n",
      "to bite me. That calmed him down, and he went off without doing any\n",
      "harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert found Mrs. Godfrey to be a pleasant, motherly-looking lady, who\n",
      "received him kindly. He felt that he should like it very much if she was\n",
      "his aunt, instead of Mrs. Stanton, whom he had never seen, and did not\n",
      "think he should care about meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think of Tom Stanton?\" asked Julia, \"Of course, you know\n",
      "him--the other boy in pa's counting-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not very well acquainted with him yet,\" said Herbert, evasively,\n",
      "for he did not care to say anything unfavorable of Tom. \"Do you know\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he used to go to the same dancing school with me last winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you know him better than I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like him much,\" said Julia. \"He's always thinking of himself\n",
      "and his neckties. He always came to dancing school in a different\n",
      "necktie; to let us know how many he had, I suppose. Didn't you notice\n",
      "his necktie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was pretty large, I thought,\" said Herbert, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's fond of wearing large ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid you are talking uncharitably, Julia,\" said her mother,\n",
      "mildly. \"Girls, you know, are sometimes fond of dress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the conversation drifted on to other topics. Julia, at first,\n",
      "addressed our hero as Mr. Mason, until he requested her to call him\n",
      "Herbert, a request which she readily complied with. They were soon on\n",
      "excellent terms, and appeared to be mutually pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young people,\" said Mr. Godfrey, after dinner, \"there is to be an\n",
      "attractive concert at the Academy of Music this evening. I secured seats\n",
      "this morning for four. Suppose we all go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted, for one, papa,\" said Julia. \"You will like to go,\n",
      "Herbert, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much,\" said our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you can escort me, while papa and mamma walk together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert felt that this arrangement would be very agreeable, so far as he\n",
      "was concerned. It was, in fact, adopted, and the four paired off\n",
      "together, as Julia had suggested, Julia amusing Herbert by her lively\n",
      "remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering the hall, they followed the usher to their seats, which were\n",
      "eligibly located only a few rows back from the stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just behind them sat a party, among whom the new arrivals produced quite\n",
      "a sensation. Not to keep the reader in suspense, that party consisted of\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Stanton, Tom and Maria. There was but slight acquaintance\n",
      "between the two families, as Mr. Godfrey's stood higher, socially, than\n",
      "Mr. Stanton's. The gentlemen, however, had a bowing acquaintance, and\n",
      "the young people had met at dancing school.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, there's Mr. Godfrey and his family, Tom,\" said Maria, turning\n",
      "towards her brother. \"Who's that boy with them? Julia hasn't got any\n",
      "brother, has she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had watched the entrance of the party with lively dissatisfaction.\n",
      "That his beggarly cousin should appear in public on such intimate terms\n",
      "with Julia Godfrey, to whom he himself had paid attention, but without\n",
      "any special encouragement, struck him as particularly mortifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Godfrey's son!\" he said, disdainfully. \"That boy is Herbert Mason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our cousin?\" asked Maria, with interest. \"Ma, did you hear?\" she\n",
      "whispered, eagerly. \"That boy in front of us is Cousin Herbert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That boy with the Godfreys?\" said Mrs. Stanton, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's talking with Julia now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure? Who told you?\"\n",

      "\"Tom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it true, Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Tom, frowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What could have induced the Godfreys to bring him along?\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Stanton, who was no better pleased than Tom at the social success of the\n",
      "poor relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's quite good-looking,\" said Maria.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" said her mother, sharply. \"He has a very countrified look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The news was communicated to Mr. Stanton, who looked with interest at\n",
      "his sister's son, whom he had not seen since he was a very young child.\n",
      "He fervently wished him back again in Ohio, where he might conveniently\n",
      "forget his existence. Here in New York, especially since an unlucky\n",
      "chance, as he considered it, had brought him into the same counting-room\n",
      "as his son, it would be difficult to avoid taking some notice of him.\n",
      "But, so far as pecuniary assistance was concerned, Mr. Stanton\n",
      "determined that he would give none, unless it was forced upon him. Had\n",
      "he known our hero better, he would have been less alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all his prejudices, Mr. Stanton could not help confessing that\n",
      "Herbert was a boy of whom any uncle might be proud. Though plainly\n",
      "dressed, he did not seem out of place at a fashionable concert,\n",
      "surrounded by well-dressed people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must not be supposed that Herbert was left in ignorance of the\n",
      "vicinity of the only relations he had in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's Tom Stanton, just behind you, with his father and mother and\n",
      "sister,\" whispered Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert turned his head slightly. He was desirous of seeing what his\n",
      "uncle and aunt were like. His uncle met his gaze, and turned\n",
      "uncomfortably away, appearing not to know him, yet conscious that in his\n",
      "affected ignorance he was acting shabbily. Mrs. Stanton did not flinch,\n",
      "but bent a cold gaze of scrutiny upon the unwelcome nephew. Tom looked\n",
      "supercilious, and elevated his pug nose a trifle. Maria, only, looked as\n",
      "if she would like to know her cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only a hasty glance on Herbert's part, but it brought him to a\n",
      "rapid conclusion that he would not claim relationship. If any advances\n",
      "were made, they must come from the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom fidgeted in his seat, watching with ill-concealed vexation the\n",
      "confidential conversation which appeared to be going on between Julia\n",
      "and his cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What she can see in that boor, I can't imagine,\" he said to himself.\n",

      "Moreover, though Julia had looked around, she had not deigned any\n",
      "recognition of himself, and this hurt his pride. He finally determined\n",
      "to overlook the neglect, and address her, which he could readily do, as\n",
      "he sat almost directly behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-evening, Miss Julia,\" he said, familiarly, bending forward.\n",

      "slightly. \"Herbert, isn't that a beautiful song?\"\n",

      "\"She calls him Herbert,\" said Tom, in scornful disgust. \"I wonder if she\n",

      "\n",
      "Herbert, upon this, bowed pleasantly, but Tom said, in rather a\n",
      "disagreeable tone, \"I know Mr. Mason slightly.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We shall know each other better by and by,\" said Herbert, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom did not appear to hear this, but tried to keep up the conversation\n",
      "with Julia, desiring to have it appear that they were intimate friends;\n",
      "but the young lady gave brief replies, and finally, turning away,\n",
      "devoted herself once more to Herbert, much to Tom's disgust. In fact,\n",
      "what he saw made Tom pass a very unpleasant evening, and when, on their\n",
      "return home, Maria suggested that Julia had taken a fancy to Herbert, he\n",
      "told her to mind her own business, which Maria justly considered a piece\n",
      "of rudeness wholly uncalled for.\n",

      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding he was receiving a salary larger than is usually paid\n",
      "boys of his age, Herbert felt cramped for the want of money. Six dollars\n",
      "a week would have paid his expenses comfortably, if he had been well\n",
      "provided to begin with. But all the clothing he had, besides what he\n",
      "wore, he had brought with him in a small bundle, the greatest part\n",
      "having been left in his trunk at the house of Abner Holden. He often\n",
      "wished that he could have them with him, but, of course, this wish was\n",
      "vain. Indeed, Mr. Holden, when the conviction was forced upon him that\n",
      "there was no chance of recovering his bound boy, quietly confiscated the\n",
      "trunk and its contents; and this, to some extent, consoled him for the\n",
      "departure of the owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert found himself sadly in need of underclothing; and, of course,\n",
      "his only suit, from constant wear, was likely to deteriorate rapidly. He\n",
      "saved all the money he could from his weekly wages toward purchasing a\n",
      "new one, but his savings were inconsiderable. Besides, he needed a\n",
      "trunk, or would need one, when he had anything to put in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I only had that money Greenleaf stole from me, I should be all\n",
      "right,\" he said to himself, after long and anxious thought on the great\n",
      "question of ways and means. \"I don't see how I can save up more than two\n",
      "dollars a week out of my wages, and it will take a long time for that to\n",
      "amount to much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There certainly did not appear to be much chance of saving more. His\n",
      "boarding place was as cheap as he could obtain, or, if there were\n",
      "cheaper anywhere, they would probably be also poorer, and our hero felt\n",
      "that Mrs. Morgan's was as poor as he should be able to endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was rather mortified, too, at the poverty of his wardrobe. Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan asked him one day, \"When is your trunk coming?\" and Herbert was\n",
      "obliged to own, with some shame, that he had none. The landlady looked\n",
      "surprised, but he had no explanation to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I shall have to wait till my wages are raised,\" thought\n",
      "Herbert, with a little sigh. This, he reflected, would not be very soon,\n",
      "as he had started with a salary greater than he was likely to earn, as\n",
      "Mr. Godfrey had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But relief was nearer than he anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, as he was walking up the Bowery, he saw, at a little distance\n",
      "in front of him, a figure which he well remembered. The careless, jaunty\n",
      "step and well-satisfied air were familiar to him. In short, it was Peter\n",
      "Greenleaf, who had played so mean a trick upon him at the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert's heart beat quick with excitement, mingled with pleasure. He\n",
      "felt a natural indignation against this young man, who had cheated him\n",
      "so remorselessly, and left him, indifferent to his fate, alone and\n",
      "almost penniless in a strange city.\n",
      "\n",
      "What should he do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Close behind him was a policeman slowly pacing his regular round.\n",
      "Herbert went up to him, and, pointing to Greenleaf, rapidly recounted\n",
      "his grievances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a mean trick,\" said the policeman, who was a favorable specimen\n",
      "of his class. \"Is this the first time you have seen him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me what you want to do.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Three weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much chance, then. Probably his pocket's empty, unless he's fleeced\n",
      "somebody else in the meantime. However, it's as well to see what can be\n",
      "done. Now, I'll tell you how to act. Go up to him boldly, and demand\n",
      "your money. If he bluffs you off, call me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hastened his step, and, advancing, tapped Greenleaf on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenleaf turned. When he recognized Herbert, he looked surprised and\n",
      "disconcerted. But he had plenty of assurance, and quickly determined\n",
      "upon his course. Assuming a stolid look, he said: \"Well, my lad, who are\n",
      "you; and what do you want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know who I am, well enough,\" said Herbert, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do I? Then I'm uncommonly forgetful. I haven't any recollection of your\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you don't want to remember me, Mr. Greenleaf,\" said Herbert.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your name was Greenleaf when you stopped with me at French's Hotel,\"\n",
      "said Herbert, sturdily.\n",
      "\n",

      "never stopped at the hotel you mention, in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's the money you took from me?\" demanded Herbert, who felt\n",
      "convinced of Greenleaf's identity, in spite of his denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you talking about?\" said Greenleaf, assuming a look of\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You went off before I was awake, with more than fifty dollars of mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to insult me?\" said Greenleaf, drawing himself up. \"I've a\n",
      "great mind to knock you over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Greenleaf,\" said Herbert, firmly, \"either return my money, or as\n",
      "much as you have got left, or I will call a policeman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just what I shall do, myself, unless you stop this nonsense,\" said\n",
      "Greenleaf, angrily; but not without a sensation of uneasiness, as it\n",
      "struck his mind that Herbert might really intend to do what he had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once more, will you give up that money?\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand out of the way,\" said Greenleaf, \"if you know what is best for\n",
      "yourself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to push by, thrusting Herbert roughly out of the way, when\n",

      "the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give this boy his money,\" he said, authoritatively. \"I know all about\n",
      "your little game. It's up now. Unless you hand over your plunder, you\n",
      "must go with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenleaf changed color, and was evidently alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got nobody's money, except my own,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along, then,\" said the officer, taking him by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop a minute,\" said he, hurriedly, finding that matters had come to a\n",
      "crisis. \"If I give up what I have, will you let me go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that depends on how much you have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got twenty dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert was about to say that this would do, but the policeman shook his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't do,\" said he. \"Come along.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little haggling, Greenleaf produced forty dollars, which Herbert\n",
      "pocketed, with much satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now go along, and mind you don't try any more such games.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenleaf needed no second permission to be gone. He feared that the\n",
      "officer might change his mind, and he might, after all, be consigned to\n",
      "the station house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Herbert, gratefully. \"I needed the money badly. I\n",
      "shouldn't have recovered it but for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take better care of it next time,\" said the officer, not unkindly.\n",
      "\"Take care not to trust a stranger too easily. Better take my advice,\n",
      "and put it in a savings bank.\" \"I shall be obliged to use most of it,\"\n",
      "said Herbert. \"What I don't need, I will put in the bank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The recovery of so much of his lost money seemed to Herbert quite a\n",
      "lucky windfall. He went at once to a trunk store, and, for five dollars,\n",
      "purchased a good, durable trunk, which he ordered sent home to his\n",
      "lodgings. Fifteen dollars more he invested in necessary underclothing,\n",
      "and this left him one-half of the money for future use. Besides this he\n",
      "had six dollars, which, in three weeks, he had saved from his wages.\n",
      "With this sum, and the articles he had purchased, he felt quite rich,\n",
      "and returned to the counting-room--this happened during the hour given\n",
      "him for dinner--in unusually good spirits. He had other reasons for\n",
      "encouragement. He was getting accustomed to his duties at the counting-\n",
      "room. Mr. Godfrey always treated him kindly, and had called upon him\n",
      "again that very morning to assist him in translating a French letter,\n",
      "complimenting him, at the same time, upon his scholarship.\n",
      "\n",

      "After the concert, Tom Stanton took even a greater dislike to his cousin\n",
      "than before. To say that he was in love with Julia Godfrey would be\n",
      "rather ridiculous, considering his youth. Even if he had been older, Tom\n",
      "cared too much about himself to fall in love with another. But Julia had\n",
      "been a belle among the children of her own age at the dancing school,\n",
      "and there was considerable rivalry among the boys--or, I should,\n",
      "perhaps, say young gentlemen--for the honor of her notice. Tom desired\n",
      "it, because it would give him a kind of distinction among his fellows.\n",
      "So, though he was not in love with Julia, he was jealous when she showed\n",
      "favor to anyone else. But this feeling was mild compared with that he\n",
      "experienced when Julia bestowed her notice upon his penniless cousin.\n",
      "That Herbert should be preferred to himself, he thought, not only showed\n",
      "great lack of taste on the part of the young heiress, but was a grievous\n",
      "wrong to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't understand how girls can be such fools,\" thought Tom, as that\n",
      "evening, after returning from the concert, he surveyed his rather\n",

      "believed Julia Godfrey would stoop to notice such a pauper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a cheerful thought came to him. Perhaps she was only trying to\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly, to an unprejudiced observer, such a thought would never have\n",

      "did not appear to argue any such feeling as would lead to the attempt to\n",
      "rouse his jealousy. But, then, Tom was not an unprejudiced observer, and\n",
      "considered his personal attractions such that any girl might appreciate\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he arrived at the counting-room the next morning, he found Herbert\n",
      "already there. Indeed, our hero was very particular to be punctual in\n",

      "\n",
      "That was what Herbert thought himself. But as Tom expressed it, there\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have found Mr. Godfrey very kind,\" he said, briefly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I suppose you don't consider it in that light,\" said Tom,\n",
      "carelessly; \"but, of course, it is clear enough to others. Where would\n",

      "probably, among the street ragamuffins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I might,\" said Herbert, quietly, \"if I couldn't have got\n",

      "\"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Tom, haughtily, his face flushing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only said to you the same thing you said to me. If it's an insult on\n",
      "one side, it is on the other.\"\n",

      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "that Herbert received more than he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't mean that,\" said he. \"Of course, if Mr. Godfrey chooses to\n",

      "\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Herbert, sarcastically.\n",

      "\"What is that?\" inquired Herbert, looking his cousin in the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't feel too much set up by Julia Godfrey's notice. She only took\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Like you, for instance!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, like me,\" said Tom, complacently, \"she would have been more\n",

      "might not understand it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only natural that Herbert should be provoked by this elaborate\n",
      "humiliation suggested by Tom, and his cousin's offensive assumption of\n",

      "\"I believe I saw you, also, at the concert, Thomas,\" said Mr. Godfrey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" said Tom. \"I am very fond of music, and attend all the\n",
      "first-class musical entertainments\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Godfrey, but this was all the reply he made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My daughter insists that I shall invite you to the house again soon,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Godfrey, again addressing Herbert.\n",
      "\n",

      "modestly. \"I shall be very glad to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom's face darkened, as he heard this. He would have given considerable\n",
      "to receive such an invitation himself, but the prospect did not seem\n",
      "very promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Godfrey must he infatuated,\" he said to himself, impatiently, \"to\n",
      "invite such a beggar to his house. Mason ought to have good sense enough\n",
      "to feel that he is out of place in such a house. I wouldn't accept any\n",
      "invitation given out of pity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder why Tom dislikes me so much?\" thought Herbert. \"He certainly\n",

      "if he knew that I was his cousin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert thought of mentioning to Mr. Godfrey that he had recovered\n",
      "three-quarters of the money of which he had been robbed. It would have\n",
      "been well if he had done so, but Mr. Godfrey seemed particularly\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert felt happier than usual. He had recovered the greater part of\n",
      "his money, and thus was relieved from various inconveniences which had\n",
      "resulted from his straitened circumstances, He was the more elated at\n",
      "this, as it had seemed extremely improbable that the lost money would\n",
      "ever have found its way back to the pocket of its rightful owner. Then,\n",
      "he had a good place, and a salary sufficient to defray his modest\n",
      "expenses, and the prospect of promotion, if he should be faithful to the\n",
      "interests of his employer, as he firmly intended to be. It was\n",
      "agreeable, also, to reflect that he was in favor with Mr. Godfrey, who\n",
      "had thus far treated him with as much kindness as if he had been his own\n",
      "son.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was, to be sure, the drawback of Tom's enmity, but, as there was\n",
      "no good reason for this, he would not allow it to trouble him much,\n",
      "though, of course, it would have been more agreeable if all in the\n",
      "office had been his friends. He determined to take an early opportunity\n",
      "to write to his good friend, Dr. Kent, an account of his present\n",
      "position. He would have done so before, but had hesitated from the fear\n",
      "that in some way the intelligence would reach Abner Holden, whom he\n",
      "preferred to leave in ignorance of all that concerned him.\n",
      "\n",
      "These thoughts passed through Herbert's mind as he went about his daily\n",

      "\n",
      "About one o'clock a gentleman entered the counting-room hastily, and\n",
      "said, \"Mr. Godfrey, I wonder whether I happened to leave my pocketbook\n",
      "anywhere about your office when I was here an hour ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think so. When did you miss it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A few minutes since. I went to a restaurant to get a lunch, and, on\n",
      "finishing it, felt for my pocketbook, and found it gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was there much in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No sum of any consequence. Between twenty and thirty dollars, I\n",
      "believe. There were, however, some papers of value, which I shall be\n",
      "sorry to lose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly think you could have left it here. However, I will inquire.\n",
      "Mr. Pratt, have you seen anything of Mr. Walton's pocketbook?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" said the bookkeeper, promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert, have you seen it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" said our hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thomas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Stanton was assailed by a sudden and dangerous temptation. His\n",
      "dislike to Herbert had been increased in various ways, and especially\n",
      "had been rendered more intense by the independent tone assumed by our\n",
      "hero in the conversation which had taken place between them that very\n",
      "morning. Now, here was an opportunity of getting him into disgrace, and\n",
      "probably cause him to lose his situation. True, he would have to tell a\n",
      "falsehood, but Tom had never been a scrupulous lover of truth, and would\n",
      "violate it for a less object without any particular compunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated when the question was asked him, and thus, as he expected,\n",
      "fixed Mr. Godfrey's attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you answer, Thomas?\" he said, in surprise.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" demanded his employer, suspiciously.\n",

      "I must obey you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, if any wrong has been done, it is your duty to expose it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, sir,\" said Tom. \"I saw Mason pick up a wallet from the floor, and\n",
      "put it in his pocket just after the gentleman went out. He did it so\n",
      "quickly that no one probably observed it but myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert listened to this accusation as if stunned. It was utterly beyond\n",
      "his conception how anyone could be guilty of such a deliberate falsehood\n",
      "as he had just listened to. So he remained silent, and this operated\n",
      "against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert,\" said Mr. Godfrey, mildly, for he was unwilling to believe our\n",
      "hero guilty of intentional dishonesty, \"you should have mentioned having\n",
      "found the pocketbook.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I would, sir,\" said Herbert, having found his voice at last, \"if I\n",
      "had found one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say that you have not?\" demanded Mr. Godfrey, with a\n",
      "searching look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, then, does Thomas mean when he asserts that he saw you do so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, sir. I think he means to injure me, as I have noticed\n",
      "ever since I entered the office that he seems to dislike me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is that, Thomas? Do you again declare that you saw Herbert pick up\n",
      "the wallet?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Tom, boldly. \"Of course, I expected that he would deny it.\n",
      "I leave it to you, sir, if he does not show his guilt in his face? Just\n",
      "look at him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it, unfortunately for Herbert, happened that his indignation had\n",
      "brought a flush to his face, and he certainly did look as a guilty\n",
      "person is supposed to do. Mr. Godfrey observed this, and his heart sank\n",
      "within him, for, unable to conceive of such wickedness as Tom's, he saw\n",
      "no other way except to believe in Herbert's guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you nothing to say, Herbert?\" he asked, more in sorrow than in\n",
      "anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" said Herbert, in a low voice; \"nothing, except what I have\n",
      "already said. Tom has uttered a wicked falsehood, and he knows it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, I expected you would say that,\" said Tom, with effrontery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a serious charge, Herbert,\" proceeded Mr. Godfrey. \"I shall\n",
      "have to ask you to produce whatever you have in your pockets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, sir,\" said our hero, calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as he spoke, it flashed upon him that he had in his pocket twenty-\n",
      "six dollars, and the discovery of this sum would be likely to involve\n",
      "him in suspicion. He could, indeed, explain where he got it; but would\n",
      "his explanation be believed? Under present circumstances, he feared that\n",
      "it would not. So it was with a sinking heart that he drew out the\n",
      "contents of his pockets, and among them his own pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that yours?\" asked Mr. Godfrey, turning to Mr. Walton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it is not; but he may have transferred my money to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this hint, Mr. Godfrey opened the pocketbook, and drew out the\n",
      "small roll of bills, which he proceeded to count.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twenty-six dollars,\" he said. \"How much did you lose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Between twenty and thirty dollars. I cannot be sure how much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here are two tens and three twos.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had two tens. I don't remember the denomination of the other bills.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Tom was struck with astonishment at this discovery. He knew that\n",
      "his charge was groundless, yet here it was substantiated in a very\n",
      "remarkable manner. Was it possible that he had, after all, struck upon\n",
      "the truth of the matter? He did not know what to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Herbert,\" said his employer, sorrowfully, \"this discovery gives me more\n",
      "pain than I can express. I had a very high idea of you. I could not have\n",
      "believed you capable of so mean a thing as deliberate dishonesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not guilty,\" said Herbert, proudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you say this in the face of all this evidence? Do you mean to\n",
      "say that this money is yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" said Herbert, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where could you have got it?\" said his employer, incredulously. \"Did\n",
      "you not tell me when you entered my employ that you were almost\n",
      "penniless? You have been with me three weeks only, and half your wages\n",
      "have been paid for board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir; you are right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What explanation, then, can you offer? Your case looks bad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The six dollars I saved from my wages, at the rate of two dollars a\n",
      "week. The twenty dollars is a part of the money I was robbed of. I\n",
      "succeeded in recovering forty dollars of it yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Herbert related the circumstances already known to the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A likely story,\" said Tom, scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be silent, Thomas,\" said Mr. Godfrey. \"Your story does not seem\n",
      "probable,\" he proceeded, speaking to Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true, sir,\" said our hero, firmly.\n",

      "\"What could he have done with your wallet, however?\" said the merchant,\n",
      "turning to Mr. Walton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has been out to the post office since,\" said Tom. \"He might have\n",
      "thrown it away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This unfortunately for Herbert, was true. He had been out, and, of\n",
      "course, could have disposed of the wallet in the way mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what to think, Mr. Walton,\" said Mr. Godfrey. \"I'm afraid\n",
      "the boy's guilty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid so. I don't care so much for the money, if he will give me\n",
      "back the papers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't do it, sir,\" said Herbert, \"for I never had them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The other boy declares that he saw this one take the wallet from the\n",
      "floor, where I probably dropped it. It seems to me that settles the\n",
      "matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid it does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once more, Herbert, will you confess?\" asked Mr. Godfrey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can only say, sir, that I am innocent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Walton, what shall we do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let the boy go. I will leave it to his honor to return me the papers,\n",
      "and he may keep the money. I think he will make up his mind to do so by\n",
      "tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hear, Herbert,\" said Mr. Godfrey. \"While this matter remains in\n",
      "doubt, you cannot retain your situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Walton, for your indulgence,\" said Herbert; \"but I am\n",

      "to do my duty, and TRUST to God to clear me.\"\n",

      "While the events recorded in the last chapter were taking place in Mr.\n",

      "office of Mr. Stanton.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had just finished reading the morning paper, and, as it slipped from\n",
      "his hand, his thoughts turned, transiently, to the nephew whose\n",
      "persistent failure to claim relationship puzzled him not a little. He\n",
      "was glad not to be called upon for money, of course; still, he felt a\n",
      "little annoyed at Herbert's reticence, especially as it left him unable\n",
      "to decide whether our hero knew of the tie which connected them. It was\n",
      "scarcely possible to suppose that he did not. But in that case, why did\n",
      "he not make some sign? The truth did suggest itself to Mr. Stanton's\n",
      "mind that the boy resented his cold and indifferent letter, and this\n",
      "thought made him feel a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was thinking over this subject, one of his clerks entered the\n",
      "office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A gentleman to see you, Mr. Stanton,\" he said, briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton raised his head, and his glance rested on a tall, vigorous\n",
      "man of perhaps thirty-five years of age, who closely followed the clerk.\n",
      "The stranger's face was brown from exposure, and there was a certain\n",
      "appearance of unconventionality about his movements which seemed to\n",
      "indicate that he was not a dweller in cities or a frequenter of drawing-\n",
      "rooms, but accustomed to make his home in the wilder haunts of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In brief, for there is no occasion for mystery, Mr. Stanton's visitor\n",
      "was Ralph the Ranger, who had assisted Herbert from the clutches of\n",
      "Abner Holden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton gazed at the stranger with some curiosity, but was unable to\n",
      "recognize him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any business with me?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the visitor, in a voice whose depth carried with it an\n",
      "assurance of strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"State it, then, as briefly as possible,\" said the merchant, with a\n",
      "little asperity, for there was not as much deference in the manner of\n",
      "the other as he thought there should have been. Like most new men, he\n",
      "was jealous of his position, and solicitous lest he should not be\n",
      "treated with due respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will do so,\" said the stranger, \"but as it cannot be summed up in a\n",
      "sentence, I will take the liberty of seating myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he sat down in an office chair, which was placed not far\n",
      "from that in which Mr. Stanton was sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My time is valuable,\" said the merchant, coldly. \"I cannot listen to a\n",
      "long story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the visitor was plainly, if not roughly, dressed, he suspected that\n",
      "he desired pecuniary assistance on some pretext or other, and that his\n",
      "story was one of misfortune, intended to appeal to his sympathies. Had\n",
      "such been the case, there was very little prospect of help from Mr.\n",
      "Stanton, and that gentleman already enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure\n",
      "of refusing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you know me?\" demanded Ralph, abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton did not anticipate such a commencement. It had never\n",
      "occurred to him to suppose that his rough visitor was one whom he had\n",
      "ever before met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he said, \"I never saw you before.\"\n",

      "\"Well, it is twelve years since we met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twelve years,\" repeated Mr. Stanton. He scanned the stranger's face\n",
      "with curiosity, but not a glimmer of recollection came to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say I met many persons at that distance of time, whom I cannot\n",
      "remember in the least now, even by name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you will remember my name,\" said Ralph, quietly. \"Your memory\n",
      "of Ralph Pendleton cannot be wholly obliterated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton started, and it was evident from the expression of his face\n",
      "that the memory was not a welcome one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you Ralph Pendleton?\" he asked, in an undecided voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but not the Ralph Pendleton you once knew. Then I was an\n",
      "inexperienced boy; now I am a man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you have changed considerably,\" said Mr. Stanton, uncomfortably,\n",
      "\"Where have you kept yourself all these years? Why have you not made\n",
      "yourself known before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before I answer these questions, I must refer to some circumstances\n",
      "well known to both of us. I hope I shall not be tiresome; I will, at\n",
      "least, be brief. You were my father's friend. At least, he so considered\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When he died, as I had not yet attained my majority, he left you my\n",
      "guardian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was in rather an idle frame, and being possessed, as I supposed, of\n",
      "fifty thousand dollars, I felt no necessity impelling me to work. You\n",
      "gave me no advice, but rather encouraged me in my idle propensities.\n",
      "When I was of age, I took a fancy to travel, and left my property in\n",
      "your hands, with full power to manage it for me. This trust you\n",
      "accepted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, this is an old story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An old one, but it shall not be a long one. My income being sufficient\n",
      "to defray my expenses abroad, I traveled leisurely, with no thought for\n",
      "the future. In your integrity I had the utmost confidence. Imagine,\n",
      "then, my dismay when, while resident in Paris, I received a letter from\n",
      "you stating that, owing to a series of unlucky investments, nearly all\n",
      "my money had been sunk, and in place of fifty thousand dollars, my\n",
      "property was reduced to a few hundreds.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was unlucky, I admit,\" said Mr. Stanton, moving uneasily in his\n",
      "chair. \"My investments were unlucky, as it turned out, but the best and\n",
      "most judicious cannot always foresee how an investment will turn out.\n",
      "Besides, I lost largely, myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you wrote me,\" said Ralph, quietly. \"However, that did not make it\n",
      "any the easier for me to bear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not, but it shows, at any rate, that I took the same risk for\n",
      "my own money that I did for others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph proceeded without noticing this remark. \"What made matters worse\n",
      "for me was that I had fallen in love with a young American lady who,\n",
      "with her parents, was then traveling in Europe. My circumstances, as I\n",
      "supposed them to be, justified me in proposing marriage. I was accepted\n",
      "by the young lady, and my choice was approved by the parents. When,\n",
      "however, I learned of my loss of fortune, I at once made it known, and\n",
      "that approval was withdrawn. The father told me that, under the altered\n",
      "circumstances, the engagement must be considered broken. Still, he held\n",
      "out the prospect that, should I ever again obtain a property as large as\n",
      "that I had lost, I might marry his daughter. She, on her part, promised\n",
      "to wait for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came to New York, received from you the remnant of my lost fortune,\n",
      "and sailed the next week for California, then just open to American\n",
      "enterprise. The most glowing stories were told of fortunes won in an\n",
      "incredibly short time, Having no regular occupation, and having a strong\n",
      "motive for acquiring money, it is not surprising that I should have been\n",
      "dazzled with the rest, and persuaded to make the journey to the land of\n",
      "gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Quixotic scheme, as I thought at the time,\" said Mr. Stanton, coldly.\n",

      "have taken the clerkship I offered you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are wrong,\" said Ralph, composedly. \"There were many who were\n",
      "disappointed, but I was not among the number.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you succeed?\" asked Mr. Stanton, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So well,\" answered the other, \"that at the end of two years' residence,\n",
      "I found myself as rich as I had ever been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had you made fifty thousand dollars?\" demanded the merchant, in\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you do? Why did you not let me know of your success?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I once more found myself possessed of a fortune, I took the next\n",
      "vessel home with my money. I had but one thought, and that was to claim\n",
      "the hand of my promised bride, who had promised to wait for me ten\n",
      "years, if necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found her married,\" said Ralph, bitterly. \"She had forgotten her\n",
      "promise, or had been over-persuaded by her parents--I do not know which\n",
      "--and had proved false to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was unfortunate. But do you still possess the money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! I congratulate you,\" said Mr. Stanton, with suavity, and he\n",
      "held out his hand, which Ralph did not appear to see. Ralph Pendleton\n",
      "rich was a very different person from Ralph Pendleton poor, and it\n",
      "occurred to him that he might so far ingratiate himself into the favor\n",
      "of his former ward as to obtain the charge of his second fortune. He saw\n",
      "that it would be safe, as well as politic, to exchange his coldness for\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I had my money; but for money itself I cared little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton shrugged his shoulders a little contemptuously. He could not\n",
      "understand how anyone could think slightingly of money, and he decided\n",
      "in his own mind that Ralph was an unpractical enthusiast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I valued money only as a means to an end, and that end was to make\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No doubt, I might have been successful in other quarters, but I did not\n",
      "care to try. I left New York in disgust, and, going West, I buried\n",
      "myself in the forest, where I built a rude cabin, and there I have lived\n",
      "since, an unsocial, solitary life. Years have passed since I visited New\n",
      "York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you do with your money all this while?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I left it in the hands of men whom I could trust. It has been\n",

      "have swelled to ninety thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" ejaculated Mr. Stanton, his respect for Ralph considerably\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I ask in what manner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I expected the question, and am come to answer it. When I returned from\n",
      "Europe impoverished, you gave me a brief statement of the manner in\n",
      "which you had invested my fortune, and showed me how it had melted away\n",
      "like snow before the sun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You remember rightly. I bought, on your account, shares in Lake\n",
      "Superior Mining Company, which promised excellently, and bade fair to\n",
      "make handsome returns. But it proved to be under the management of\n",
      "knaves, and ran quickly down from par to two per cent., at which price I\n",
      "thought best to sell out, considering that a little saved from the wreck\n",
      "was better than nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is according to the statement you made me,\" said Ralph, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said Mr. Stanton, \"that no one regretted more than I do the\n",
      "disastrous result. Indeed, I had reason to do so, for I was myself\n",
      "involved, and suffered considerable loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am aware now that you were concerned in the matter,\" said Ralph,\n",
      "significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Stanton, quickly, detecting something\n",
      "peculiar in his tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you. You were right in denouncing the management as knavish.\n",
      "The company was got up by knaves, on a basis of fraud, and was from the\n",
      "first intended as a trap for the unwary. But there is one important\n",
      "circumstance which you have neglected to mention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is that?\" asked Mr. Stanton, in a voice which strove to be\n",
      "composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean this,\" said Ralph, firmly, \"that you yourself were the prime\n",
      "originator of the company--that you engineered it through to the end--\n",
      "that you invested my money with the express intention of converting it\n",
      "to your own profit. I charge you with this, that all, or nearly all the\n",
      "property I lost, went into your pocket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The color came and went in Mr. Stanton's face. He seemed staggered by\n",
      "this sudden and unexpected accusation, and did not at first make reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling forced to speak at last, he said: \"This is very strange\n",
      "language, Mr. Pendleton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is unexpected, no doubt, for after all these years you probably\n",
      "thought it would remain forever unknown; but in what respect is it\n",
      "strange? I have given you a statement of facts as directly as I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are not facts. Your charge is wholly false,\" said the merchant,\n",
      "but his tone was not that of a man. who speaks the truth boldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could believe it,\" said Ralph. \"I wish I could believe that I\n",
      "was not deliberately swindled by one who professed to be my father's\n",
      "friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On what authority do you bring this monstrous charge?\" demanded Mr.\n",
      "Stanton, more boldly. \"How happens it that you have not made it before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the simple reason that I myself did not suspect any fraud. I\n",
      "presumed that it was as you stated to me, and that your only fault was\n",
      "your injudicious investment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I admit that, as it turned out, the investment was injudicious.\n",
      "Everything else I deny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your denial is vain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot prove the truth of what you say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you fall back on that? But you are mistaken. I can prove the truth\n",
      "of what I say,\" said Ralph firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you remember a man named David Marston?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is dead,\" said Mr. Stanton, hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you have supposed,\" said Ralph; \"but you were deceived. He is not\n",
      "dead. I only encountered him a week since, quite by accident, in my\n",
      "Western home. He was your confidential clerk, you remember, and fully\n",
      "acquainted with all your business transactions at the time of which I am\n",
      "speaking. From him I learned how basely I had been deceived, and with\n",
      "what deliberate cruelty you conspired to rob the son of your dead\n",
      "friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe David Marston is alive,\" said Mr. Stanton, hoarsely,\n",
      "with a certain terror in his face. \"Indeed, I have proof that he is\n",
      "dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know the character of your proof. A paper was forwarded to you from\n",
      "Australia, whither you had sent him, containing the record of his\n",
      "death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes? What have you to say against this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That the publication was a mistake. He was dangerously sick, and it was\n",
      "falsely announced that he was dead. That notice was sent to you, and you\n",
      "believed it to be true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it now,\" said Mr. Stanton, doggedly. \"Why should I not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you wish to be convinced, proof is at hand. Wait a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph Pendleton rose from his seat and left the counting-room. Two\n",
      "minutes had not passed when he returned with an elderly man, thin of\n",
      "face and wasted in figure, looking twenty years older than Mr. Stanton,\n",
      "though really of about the same age.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is David Marston,\" said Ralph--\"the living proof that I have told\n",
      "you the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton gazed at him wildly, for to him it was as the face of one\n",
      "risen from the dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you do, Mr. Stanton?\" said David Marston, humbly. \"It is many,\n",
      "many years since we met, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you really David Marston?\" demanded Mr. Stanton, never taking his\n",
      "eyes off the shrunken figure of his old clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am, sir; greatly changed indeed, but still the David Marston who was\n",
      "formerly in your employ. Time hasn't treated me as well as it has you,\n",
      "sir. I've been unlucky, and aged fast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid your mind is also affected. You have been telling strange\n",
      "stories to Mr. Pendleton here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True stories, sir,\" said David, firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, how much is he going to give you for this evidence of\n",
      "yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop, Mr. Stanton! You insult us both,\" said Ralph Pendleton, sternly.\n",
      "\"I am not the man to buy false evidence, nor is David Marston the man to\n",
      "perjure himself for pay. David, I want you, in Mr. Stanton's presence,\n",
      "to make a clear statement of his connection with the mining company by\n",
      "which I lost my fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "David Marston obeyed, and in a few words as possible unfolded the story.\n",
      "It is not necessary to repeat it here. Enough that it fully\n",
      "substantiated the charge which Ralph had brought against his early\n",
      "guardian,\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished, Ralph said, \"You can judge what weight Marston's\n",
      "testimony would have before a court of justice, and whether it would\n",
      "help your commercial standing to have his story made public.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it you want of me?\" said Mr. Stanton, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want restitution, dollar for dollar, of my lost money. I will waive\n",
      "interest, though I might justly claim it. But, were it all paid,\n",
      "interest and principal, the wrong would not be redressed. You cannot\n",
      "restore the bride who would have been mine but for your villainy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How much time will you give me to pay this money?\" asked the merchant,\n",

      "But an hour before he had rejoiced in his excellent prospects, and,\n",
      "depending on the favor of his employer and his own fidelity, had looked\n",
      "forward to a bright future. Now all was changed. He was dismissed from\n",
      "his situation in disgrace, suspected of a mean theft. He had, to be\n",
      "sure, the consciousness of innocence, and that was a great deal. He was\n",
      "not weighed down by the feeling of guilt, at least. Still his prospects\n",
      "were dark. Suppose the matter should not be cleared up, and he should\n",
      "still remain under suspicion? How could he hope to obtain another place\n",
      "without a recommendation from his late employer? No; he must resign all\n",
      "hope of a position and adopt some street occupation, such as selling\n",

      "own age doing. He did not doubt but that in some way he could get a\n",
      "living, but still he would be under suspicion, and that was hard to\n",
      "bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these things were passing through his mind he walked down\n",
      "Broadway, with his eyes fixed upon the sidewalk. All at once he started\n",
      "to hear his name called, and, looking up, to his unbounded astonishment\n",
      "he saw before him Ralph the Ranger, whom he had supposed a thousand\n",
      "miles away in his cabin in the Ohio woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of a friendly face was most welcome to him at such a time, and\n",

      "\"And you are the one I most wanted to see,\" said Ralph, his tone\n",
      "unconsciously softened by his friendly interest in the boy before him.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"In trouble, boy? I am sorry for that. Is it money? I can get you out of\n",
      "that trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not that exactly, Ralph. If you will come into the City Hall Park\n",
      "and sit down on a bench with me I will tell you all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Instead of that, let us go into the Astor House,\" said Ralph. \"It is\n",
      "where I am stopping.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are stopping at the Astor House?\" said Herbert, in momentary\n",
      "surprise. \"Perhaps you do not know that there are cheaper hotels. Shall\n",
      "I direct you to one?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Herbert, I am not poor, as you perhaps think. I suppose I should be\n",

      "affairs require attention. Come in.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, Herbert, take a chair and tell me all,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "To repeat Herbert's story here is unnecessary. Ralph listened with\n",
      "attention, and when it was concluded he said: \"The main thing is to\n",

      "\"Now. I have nothing else to occupy me, and the sooner you are righted\n",
      "the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went out together, and made their way at once to the spot where\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"In half an hour, then, I want you to go with me to this boys employer\n",
      "and repeat your story. The possession of the money has caused him to be\n",
      "suspected, and your evidence, confirming his own, will clear him of\n",
      "having obtained it improperly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will go,\" said the officer, \"and shall be glad to get him out of a\n",

      "Godfrey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The explanation is satisfactory,\" said Mr. Godfrey, \"and convinces me.\n",
      "It does not, however, absolutely clear you, since between the time of\n",

      "on the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert's countenance fell, but Mr. Godfrey hastened to add. \"Although\n",
      "your vindication is not complete, I will say that I believe you fully,\n",
      "and will receive you back into my employ.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have forgotten one thing, sir,\" said Herbert. \"Thomas declares that\n",
      "he saw me pick up the wallet and put it in my pocket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I did,\" said Tom, boldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Godfrey looked perplexed, and was hesitating what to say when Mr.\n",
      "Walton, the owner of the lost pocketbook, hurriedly entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Godfrey,\" he said, \"I have to beg your pardon, and, most of all,\n",
      "the pardon of this boy,\" indicating Herbert. \"I have found my\n",
      "pocketbook. I didn't lose it here, but my pocket was picked in the\n",
      "street. The pickpocket was arrested, and the wallet has been returned to\n",
      "me. This boy is innocent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad to hear it,\" said Mr. Godfrey, with emphasis. \"Herbert,\n",
      "I will try to make amends to you for my transient suspicions of your\n",
      "honesty. As for you,\" he continued, turning to Thomas and speaking\n",
      "sternly, \"I despise you for your mean attempt to injure your fellow-\n",
      "clerk. You must leave my employment to-day. I shall write to your father\n",
      "the reasons for dismissing you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can get along without your paltry four dollars a week,\" said Tom,\n",
      "with bravado. \"I am not a beggar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may be something worse, if you do not amend, \"said Mr. Godfrey.\"\n",
      "Mr. Pratt, you may pay him for the entire week, and he can go at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Tom professed so much disdain for the four dollars a week, he\n",
      "did not decline the week's pay directed to be paid to him, but placed\n",
      "the money in his vest pocket and went out with assumed nonchalance,\n",
      "though, in reality, deeply mortified at the unexpected discovery of his\n",
      "meanness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for you, Herbert,\" said Mr. Godfrey, \"you can come back at once, and\n",
      "I will raise your pay to eight dollars a week. I owe you some reparation\n",
      "for the injury you came so near suffering. I will never again doubt your\n",
      "integrity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" said Herbert; \"I shall be glad to come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before this matter is decided,\" said Ralph, \"I have a proposition to\n",
      "make to Herbert. I am rich, and have no one to share or inherit my\n",
      "wealth. I propose to adopt him--to give him an opportunity to complete\n",
      "his education in Europe, whither I propose going, and if some years\n",
      "hence you shall be willing to receive him, he can then enter your\n",
      "counting-room to learn business. The amount of compensation will be\n",
      "unimportant, as I shall provide for him amply.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert stared at Ralph in amazement. He could hardly realize that the\n",
      "offer was indeed a genuine one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean that I am to go to Europe with you, Ralph?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall like it VERY MUCH,\" said Herbert, enthusiastically. \"How can I\n",
      "thank you for so much generous kindness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your companionship will cheer me, and give me something to live for,\n",
      "Herbert,\" said Ralph. \"Through you I hope some day to enjoy life again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert's clasped the Ranger's hand in impulsive gratitude, while his\n",
      "face beamed with pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I congratulate you, Herbert,\" said Mr. Godfrey, kindly, \"though I am\n",
      "sorry to lose you. Whenever your guardian is ready to have you enter on\n",
      "a business career, a place in my counting-room shall be open to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ralph,\" said Herbert, seriously, as they went from the counting-room in\n",
      "company, \"all that has happened seems so wonderful that I am a little\n",
      "afraid I shall wake up to find it all a dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a change to me also,\" said Ralph, \"to have a new interest in\n",
      "life. The past is a sealed book. Let us look forward to a bright and\n",
      "pleasant future. Whatever pleasures and advantages money can obtain for\n",
      "you shall be yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Herbert, gratefully.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXIV\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you boarding, Herbert?\" asked Ralph.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Stanton Street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall wish you at once to remove to the Astor House, in order that we\n",
      "may be together until we sail for Europe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this pleasant arrangement Herbert made no opposition. He found it a\n",
      "great change from the dirty and slipshod boarding-house to the elegant\n",
      "arrangements of a first-class hotel. It is needless to say that he\n",
      "enjoyed that change not a little. He often had the feeling, of which he\n",
      "had spoken to Ralph, that it was a dream from which he would some time\n",
      "awake. But the dream was destined to be a pretty long one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a week, much against his will, Mr. Stanton paid over to Ralph\n",
      "Pendleton the fifty thousand dollars of which he had years ago defrauded\n",
      "him, and thus the Ranger found himself master of a fortune of nearly one\n",
      "hundred and fifty thousand dollars. He settled without delay a\n",
      "comfortable annuity on David Marston, the old clerk, through whose\n",
      "evidence he had been able to ferret out the treachery of Mr. Stanton.\n",
      "Marston needed it, for his health was broken down and he was an invalid,\n",
      "prematurely old. He is now settled in a comfortable boarding-house in\n",
      "Clinton Street, and usually spends his mornings at the Mercantile\n",
      "Library Reading-Room, in Astor Place, reading the morning papers.\n",
      "Sometimes he ventures downtown, and takes a slow walk through the\n",
      "streets, crowded with busy, bustling men, and recalls the years when he,\n",
      "too, was one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before sailing for Europe, Herbert expressed a desire to repay his uncle\n",
      "the sum of ten dollars, which the latter had sent to him. Ralph was\n",
      "surprised when he learned that this uncle, of whom Herbert spoke, was\n",
      "the same man who had been his former guardian. He approved our hero's\n",
      "determination, and one morning Herbert entered for the first time his\n",
      "uncle's place of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Stanton in?\" he asked of a clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clerk, in reply, pointed to the office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "His uncle looked up, but although he had seen our hero at a concert at\n",
      "the Academy of Music, he did not recognize him in the new and\n",
      "fashionable suit which Ralph had purchased for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Stanton, I suppose?\" said Herbert, with quiet self-possession.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Do you wish to speak with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must introduce myself,\" said Herbert. \"I am Herbert Mason, your\n",
      "nephew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Stanton, surprised. \"When did you come to the city?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some weeks since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What brought you here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had my living to make. I preferred to make it in the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The city is crowded. You had better have remained in the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not think so,\" said Herbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could have got a place on a farm, and in time perhaps might have\n",
      "bought a little land for yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did get a place on a farm,\" he said; \"but I did not like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing in the city? Have you got a place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I supposed,\" said his uncle, frowning. \"I told you the city was\n",
      "overcrowded. You should not have come here. I suppose you relied on me\n",
      "to help you to something. But I have my own family to take care of, and\n",
      "my first duty is to them, as you must be aware.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think you quite understand my object in calling,\" said Herbert,\n",
      "quietly. \"I have not come for assistance of any kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" returned Mr. Stanton, appearing to be puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You sent me ten dollars in a letter to Dr. Kent some months since?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I felt that it was best for you to depend on yourself, and that\n",
      "more would only encourage you to idleness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come to thank you for the LOAN,\" said Herbert, emphasizing the\n",
      "last word, \"and to return the money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Stanton, now thoroughly amazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert repeated his former words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't understand this. You are out of a place; yet you do not\n",
      "need this money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I do not need it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was certainly astonishing, and Mr. Stanton gazed at his nephew as\n",
      "if he did not know what to make of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are your plans?\" he asked. \"What are you going to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sail for Europe next week,\" said Herbert, enjoying his uncle's\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sail for Europe!\" ejaculated Mr. Stanton, scarcely believing his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am to go to school there, and shall probably remain three or\n",
      "four years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are trifling with me,\" said his uncle, irritably. \"How can you go\n",
      "to Europe without money?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Herbert felt that the time had come for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A friend,\" he said, \"kindly undertakes to pay all my expenses. I go\n",
      "with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is your friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Ralph Pendleton. I believe you know him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ralph Pendleton!\" repeated Mr. Stanton, in renewed surprise. \"How did\n",
      "you become acquainted with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The farmer with whom I was placed in Ohio ill-treated me. Ralph lived\n",
      "near by, and helped me to run away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton made no comment. Indeed, his surprise was such that he knew\n",
      "not what to say. His friendless and penniless nephew, as he had regarded\n",
      "him, was about to share advantages which he would gladly have obtained\n",
      "for his own son. When, that evening, at home, he told his family of\n",
      "Herbert's good fortune, Tom was filled with bitter envy. If it had been\n",
      "any other boy he would have cared less, but for \"that begger Herbert\" to\n",
      "go to Europe in charge of a man of wealth was very mortifying to his\n",
      "pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stanton made a faint protest against receiving the ten dollars\n",
      "tendered by his nephew, but Herbert was determined to repay it. He\n",
      "placed it on the desk and eventually Mr. Stanton placed it in his\n",
      "pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some reflection, finding his nephew very differently situated from\n",
      "what he had supposed, Mr. Stanton, with the concurrence of his wife,\n",
      "whose opinion also had been changed, sent an invitation to Ralph and\n",
      "Herbert to dine with them previous to their sailing for Europe. Herbert,\n",
      "by his new guardian's direction, returned a polite reply, to the effect\n",
      "that they were too busy in making preparations for their departure to\n",
      "accept the invitation. Ralph did not feel like sitting as the guest of a\n",
      "man who had cruelly defrauded him, and had only done him justice when he\n",
      "was actually compelled to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "In due time our hero sailed for Europe with Mr. Ralph Pendleton. They\n",
      "divided their time between Paris and Berlin, Herbert studying at both\n",
      "places. With his natural good abilities, he made rapid progress, and at\n",
      "the end of four years was an accomplished scholar, able to speak both\n",
      "French and German with facility. In watching his progress, Ralph\n",
      "Pendleton found a new and fresh interest in life. He recovered from his\n",
      "old, morbid feeling, and became cheerful and happy. On returning to New\n",
      "York, Herbert, who felt that he should enjoy a life of business better\n",
      "than a professional career, entered the counting-room of Mr. Godfrey. At\n",
      "twenty-one, the junior partner retiring, he was received as partner in\n",
      "his place, his guardian, Ralph Pendleton, purchasing an interest for him\n",
      "at a cost of fifty thousand dollars. He developed good business\n",
      "abilities, and bid fair to swell this sum, in time, to a large fortune.\n",
      "There is a prospect that he will, in time, sustain a closer relation to\n",
      "his senior partner, as it is rumored that Julia Godfrey, now a brilliant\n",
      "young belle, prefers her father's young partner to any of the crowd of\n",
      "young men who pay her court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characters in our story demand a few closing words. First, for\n",
      "Mr. Stanton. It might have been the sudden withdrawal of the fifty\n",
      "thousand dollars from his business that embarrassed him. At any rate,\n",
      "from that time nothing prospered with him. He met with loss after loss,\n",
      "until, in a time of financial panic he failed. He saved but a little\n",
      "from the wreck of his fortune, That little started him in a modest\n",
      "business, yielding him, perhaps, one-tenth his former income. The\n",
      "brownstone house was sold. He moved into a shabby house in an obscure\n",
      "street, where Mrs. Stanton spends her time mostly in bewailing the loss\n",
      "of her former splendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom developed habits of extravagance, and seemed indisposed to work\n",
      "steadily. Finally, when his reverses came, his father was compelled to\n",
      "refuse further assistance, and now Tom, in an inferior clerkship, on a\n",
      "small salary, gazes with envy at his once-despised cousin, with whom he\n",
      "has completely changed places. How he will come out eventually is\n",
      "doubtful. Unless he changes considerably, it is not likely that his\n",
      "circumstances will ever be much better than at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abner Holden died suddenly last year in a fit of delirium tremens. His\n",
      "habits of intemperance grew upon him until they led to this sad result.\n",
      "His death did not excite any very prolonged grief in the community, as\n",
      "his temper and uncertain honesty had made him very far from popular. To\n",
      "the housekeeper who had been kind to him, Herbert sent a valuable silk\n",
      "dress, of the richest fabric, of which Mrs. Bickford is very proud. She\n",
      "only wears it on great occasions, and then is particular to mention that\n",
      "it was presented to her by Herbert Mason, of the great New York firm of\n",
      "Godfrey & Mason, who was once Abner Holden's bound boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was Herbert forgetful of his good friends, the Kents. He paid off\n",
      "the mortgage on the doctor's place, and insisted on putting the house in\n",
      "thorough repair, and newly furnishing it, so that now the town of\n",
      "Waverley does not contain a handsomer house, inside and out, than that\n",
      "of Dr. Kent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we bid farewell to our young hero, fairly launched on a prosperous\n",
      "career, trusting that his life-path may be bright to the end, and that\n",
      "he may leave behind him, at the end of his career, the reputation of a\n",
      "noble and honorable merchant, and a life filled with good deeds.\n",
